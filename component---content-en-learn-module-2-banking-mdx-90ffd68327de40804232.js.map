To be solvent means to possess assets in excess of liabilities, so solvency is really the ability to pay your debts.

For instance, a house is an asset, but you can’t use it to pay for your cell phone bill, without going through a number of intervening steps. Liquidity really means “cash”: all of the value you possess which can be used to pay for debts right now. By law, banks must be solvent, hence the focus of traditional economics. However, Mehrling is making the point here that “liquidity is what really drives all the action” in FedWire, the overnight money markets, and the kind of shadow banking this course studies.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To understand liquidity fully, we need to recognise that there are different prices of money.
