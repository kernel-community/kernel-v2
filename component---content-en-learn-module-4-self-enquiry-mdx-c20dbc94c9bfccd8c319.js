However, that account can birth multiple other accounts in the form of an upside-down tree structure, all linked together, which only you can know about (unless you disclose them). Such accounts can function like the pseudonymous “alts” Aaron is primarily writing about and the experience of time from the points of view of these multiple personae is more ephemeral and discontinuous, rather than having to present as one, supposedly coherent stream.

You need not leave any discernible trace when operating in this manner, and this brings us back to portability and Kei’s notion of the care with which we must yield such powerful identity regimes.

Now it becomes clear that identity in web3 is not going to be ‘solved’ by some standard or service provider.
