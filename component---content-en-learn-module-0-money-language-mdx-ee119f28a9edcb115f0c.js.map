The first major technological evolution is to exchange something you can't eat: shells, beads, feathers, a string with knots etc., so that money takes a more abstract form. It moves away from the tangible consumption of intrinsic value, and becomes something which refers to value as an abstraction. Precious metals fairly quickly became the most popular way of doing this because they're scarce, transportable, divisible, and universally valued for aesthetic purposes. It took thousands of years for this invention to take root, and we see it occurring around the time of the agrarian revolution. Then nothing for a few thousand years.
