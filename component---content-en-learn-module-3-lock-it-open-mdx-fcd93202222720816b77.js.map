It turns out that there are both good technical and cultural reasons. On the technical front - as Brewster indicates - distrbuted architectures naturally lend themselves to more privacy. Moreover, because they present different challenges in terms of navigability and location-based content, they have necessitated further advancements in content-addressability and peer-to-peer discovery protocols. In turn, these will enable an archival of content to be fully functional, rather than a poor snapshot, enabling rich memory and versioning systems so that the record of human knowledge is not quite so fragile to ongoing decay.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Moreover, distributed systems lend themselves well to `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJmqcSlV07SXBLZ2r-nRHFjBRjFy-2-1CT6lVzfv8OA/edit?usp=sharing\"\n      }}>{`local culture and genuinely civic spaces`}</a>{`, both online and off. Brewster often talks about `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`a globe of villages, not a global village`}</strong>{`: we want everyone to be able to connect to whom they please, but we do not want to cultivate monocultures because we recognise that diversity is the natural response to adversity.
