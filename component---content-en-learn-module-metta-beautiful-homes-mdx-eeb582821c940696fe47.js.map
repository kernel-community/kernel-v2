Remember that Illich made the point–when describing how “body count” is the measure of success in war, or “gross profit” the measure of success in business– that “growth conceived as open-ended consumption can never lead to maturity.” Schumacher beats the same drum, asking “what sort of meaning does the method of economics actually produce?” To which the conclusion is currently obvious:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`“Something is uneconomic when it fails to earn an adequate profit in terms of money. The method of economics does not, and cannot, produce any other meaning `}{`[...]`}{` The judgement of economics is an extremely `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`fragmentary`}</em>{` judgement; out of the large number of aspects which in real life have to be seen and judged together before a decision can be taken, economics supplies only one–whether a thing yields a monetary profit `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`to those who undertake it`}</em>{` `}{`[...]`}{` It is inherent in the methodology of economics to `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`ignore man’s dependence on the natural world`}</em>{`.”`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`Even the attempt to include some externalities in our accounting is an ethically misguided cover up, for it obscures the fact that tools like cost benefit analyses are really procedures for reducing the higher to the lower and giving the priceless a price. `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`This pretence that everything may be given a price implies that money is the highest of all values when, in truth, money is everything which `}<em parentName=\"strong\">{`isn’t`}</em>{` valuable`}</strong>{` (because it is an abstract representation of that which is actually valuable). `}</p>\n    <p>{`Schumacher gives an even more detailed economic argument about the nature of “goods” as a means of extending the claims he made about our lack of accounting for the difference between irreplaceable natural capital and income generated by human methods. He makes the point that there are “primary goods” (natural resources) which humans do not create, and that these exist in two `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`essentially`}</em>{` different categories: non-renewable and renewable; and that there are “secondary goods” (made by humans) which also fall into two `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`essentially`}</em>{` different categories: manufactures and services. His claim is that we cannot disregard the differences between these four kinds of good without losing touch with reality.`}</p>\n    <p>{`However, “the market knows nothing of these distinctions. It provides a price tag for all goods and thereby enables us to pretend that they are all of equal significance.” Kernel fellow Matt Stephenson and some friends have created a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://research.wu.ac.at/en/publications/a-practical-theory-of-fungibility-6\"\n      }}>{`practical theory`}</a>{` that proposes “degrees of fungibility” which differentiate goods “according to both their underlying attributes and the perceived value and/or usefulness of those attributes to a value assessor.” Goods on the more fungible end of the spectrum can be usefully represented in markets; goods that are less fungible are perhaps reduced by representation in terms of pure price. Nevertheless, all such considerations still only apply to secondary goods–and this is Schumacher’s major point.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As Brennan Mulligan describes it: “commoditizing the priceless so that it can be accounted for by economic means, while well intentioned, is out of touch with reality because it misses something essential about those things that are priceless: i.e. that they are convivial, open, shared, and inseparable from the people and systems which constitute them.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Again, Schumacher is not against the market per se–just as Illich is not against learning–he is simply making the point that confusing the ends (peaceful, wise relationship) with the means (a unified framework for fair trade) destroys our power to choose the ends we really favour.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This focus on the ends we really favour leads him to perhaps the most famous chapter of the book on “`}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/07/07/buddhist-economics-schumacher/\"\n      }}>{`Buddhist Economics`}</a>{`” (though he, like Illich, ended life as a devout Catholic). Given that Maria Popova has already provided an excellent summary of that chapter, we will only note here how he extends the idea we ended the previous essay with, because Buddhism provides a meaningful philosophy of work (though it is not alone in this matter: all streams of the perennial tradition do).`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`“To strive for leisure as an alternative to work would be considered a complete misunderstanding of one of the basic truths of human existence, namely that work and leisure are complementary parts of the same living process and cannot be separated without destroying the joy of work and the bliss of leisure.”`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"to-the-centre\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}>{`To The Centre`}<a parentName=\"h2\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#to-the-centre\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"to the centre permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor-link after\"\n      }}><span parentName=\"a\">{`¶`}</span></a></h2>\n    <p>{`We have already seen the many ways in which Schumacher and Illich’s insights are essentially the same; now it is time to weave them fully together. Schumacher makes the point that the task of education, “first and foremost, is the transmission of ideas of value, of what to do with our lives.” We cannot surrender these ideas of value to institutions which would treat them as anomalies to be cured. “Education cannot help us as long as it accords no place to metaphysics”, which is to say that, if we have not examined our fundamental convictions with others, we are not really educated and cannot be of real value to society. Schumacher offers us his core insight in this way:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`“All subjects, no matter how specialised, are `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consilience\"\n        }}>{`connected with a centre`}</a>{`; they are like rays emanating from a sun. The centre is constituted by our most basic convictions, by those ideas which really have power to move us. In other words, the centre consists of metaphysics and ethics, of ideas that–whether we like it or not–transcend the world of facts. Because they transcend the world of facts, they cannot be proved or disproved by ordinary scientific method. But `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://youtu.be/Lbk3lA6zCic?t=4665\"\n        }}>{`that does not mean that they are purely ‘subjective’ or ‘relative’`}</a>{` or mere arbitrary conventions. They must be true to reality, although they transcend the world of facts–an apparent paradox to our positivistic thinkers.”`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`“Education can help us only if it produces ‘whole humans'. The truly educated person is not one who knows a bit of everything, not even one who knows all the details of all subjects (if such a thing were possible): the ‘whole human’, in fact, may have little detailed knowledge of facts and theories, they may treasure the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Encyclopedia Britannica`}</em>{` because ‘she knows and they don’t’, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`but they will be truly in touch with the centre`}</em>{`. They will be in no doubt about their basic convictions, about their view on the meaning and purpose of their life.

However, this does not mean it is subjective, though it transcends the world of facts and therefore cannot be fully judged by another. It is what John Vervaeke calls in the video linked above “transjective”: which refers to the “fittedness” of object and subject such that `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`meaningful`}</em>{` knowledge and action are possible. This means we may indeed be held accountable for how we think and live, though this is only just when done through the process of dialogic reason. As the perennial tradition tells us: it is your own soul who will ask you on judgement day, “Why?”`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"emerging-life\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}>{`Emerging Life`}<a parentName=\"h2\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#emerging-life\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"emerging life permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor-link after\"\n      }}><span parentName=\"a\">{`¶`}</span></a></h2>\n    <p>{`What Illich calls “drill instruction”–those skills which can be taught–are, in Schumacher’s language, made up of “convergent problems”. In some sense, these are humankind’s most useful invention precisely because they do not really exist: they are created by processes of abstraction and–once they have been solved–may be written down and passed on to others, who can apply the solution without needing to reproduce the mental effort necessary to find it. Solutions to convergent problems–like how to optimise the production of paper clips–are incredibly efficient, though that efficiency may be used in constructive or destructive ways depending on the depth of awareness and the quality of the convictions of those who apply them.`}</p>\n    <p>{`However, the above question, “Why?” is not a convergent problem. Schumacher quotes G. N. M. Tyrell, who calls these “divergent” problems in order to distinguish them from the logically solvable, convergent kind. Schumacher then writes:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`“It is easy enough to see that all through our lives we are faced with the task of reconciling opposites which, in logical thought, cannot be reconciled.

Production by the masses mobilises the priceless resources possessed by every human being: their clever brains and skilful hands.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`“The system of `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`mass production`}</em>{` is inherently violent, ecologically damaging, self-defeating in terms of non-renewable resources, and stultifying of the human person.

Choose whichever you like, but note the shared characteristics: relatability, creativity, common use, open access, simplicity, resilience. Schumacher also introduces the term “home-comer” which matches beautifully with Illich’s notion of “Epimethean”: those who have the depth of conviction and “courage to say ‘no’ to the fashions and fascinations of the age and to question the presuppositions of a civilisation which appears destined to conquer the whole world.” Drawing on the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205&version=NIV\"\n      }}>{`beatitudes from Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount`}</a>{`, Schumacher translates them into modern idiom:`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`We are poor, not demigods.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`We have plenty to be sorrowful about, and are not emerging into a golden age.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`We need a gentle approach, a non-violent spirit, and small is beautiful.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`We must concern ourselves with justice and see right prevail.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`All this, and only this, can enable us to become peacemakers.`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`This is the ground truth school does not advertise: there is no golden age, nor has there ever been.

Schumacher arrived here fifty years before us:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`“The whole crux of economic life–and indeed of life in general–is that it constantly requires the living reconciliation of opposites which, in strict logic, are irreconcilable. In macroeconomics it is necessary always to have both planning and freedom–not by way of a weak and lifeless compromise, but by a free recognition of the legitimacy of and need for both. Equally in microeconomics: on the one hand it is essential that there should be full managerial responsibility and authority; yet it is equally essential that there should be a democratic and free participation of the workers in management decisions `}{`[...]`}{` A generous and magnanimous intellectual effort–the opposite of nagging, malevolent criticism–can enable society to find a middle way that reconciles the opposites without degrading them both.”`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`This wisely balanced whole, resonating with multiple rhythms, neither grades nor degrades us and the opposites we must each reconcile in the act of living this one wild and precious life we are given.

If you take a five year course, that means you consume one hundred and fifty years of labour. Schumacher asks, “Who has the right to consume such vast quantities of value?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Is education that which creates a ‘passport to privilege’ or does it serve the people, both in content and in the way it directs the attention of the educated? The first creates a ‘trade union of the privileged’, intent on protecting their privilege. The latter takes us back–via intermediate, convivial technologies–to the people who, directly or indirectly, have paid for it and to whom we are honour bound to return the favour. Some exemplary principles in line with Schumacher’s belief may be found `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.regis.edu/about/jesuit-education/key-jesuit-values\"\n      }}>{`here`}</a>{`. Schumacher makes the point that:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`“The life, work, and happiness of all societies depend on certain ‘psychological structures’ which are infinitely precious and highly vulnerable. Social cohesion, co-operation, mutual respect, and above all self-respect, courage in the face of adversity, and the ability to hear hardship–all this and much else disintegrates” when we do not honour our fellows and are thus not in contact with, actually touching, that centre which is the measure of how whole human beings freely conduct themselves.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`This really is the last crux we will shoulder in trying to relate our educational philosophy (which comes to us from the Greek `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`philo-sophia`}</em>{`, meaning ‘love of wisdom’). Humankind does have a certain freedom of choice, but we are bound by truth. As Schumacher says, “Only in service of truth is perfect freedom.” When we are asked to ‘free our imagination from bondage to the existing system’, we would do well to reflect on whether those who ask this of us are able to point to what is real and true.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We are not called to discover truth that has not been discovered before. We are only called to live truly. Schumacher finds his solace in the Four Cardinal Virtues: prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.
