If you don’t agree that the initial\ndistribution of wealth doesn’t affect long-run wealth inequality, you can try find a\ncounterexample: an initial distribution which does affect inequality. You can experiment easily,\nmaking modifications to a few lines of code, trying to find instances where the initial\ndistribution matters.
