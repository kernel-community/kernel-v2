These are control systems that include three terms: one which is proportional to the \"error\" created by feedback (this is the most significant and immediate way in which the controller changes how the system is tuned); one which is an integral of the error over time (a smaller effect which smooths out the historical behaviour of the system so that it doesn't just oscillate between increasingly large responses over time); and a derivate term which seeks to anticipate changes in the system and adjust the rate at which it responds, also smoothing its behaviour over time.`}</p>\n    <p>{`RAI implements both the proportional and integral terms in its `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb\"\n      }}>{`contracts`}</a>{`, and applies them to this idea of a \"redemption price\", or internal system peg. The \"error\" is read from the current market price: i.e. what RAI is trading at on secondary markets. If the market price is above the redemption price, then the proportional term in the automatic rate setter increases the redemption price, creating a propotionally greater incentive to mint RAI and sell it on the open market for a profit. If the market price drops below the redemption price, the proportional term decreases the redemption price, creating a proportionally greater incentive to buy RAI on the open market, exchange it for ETH, and redeem your position for a profit in the contract itself.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The integral term behaves something like system memory, as it stores the \"error\" of the last 30 days.
