The mind must work with the body to EMBODY the feeling, the thought, the image.

Embodied understanding only comes with practice, and training these things is not easy. It is rigorous and time-demanding. It's awkward and humiliating. It's often cringe.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Dance has been gatekeeping these ancient practices, and it has also, until now, been unable to translate its ephemerality into the digital world.

For example, dance halts the aging process of the brain itself, so if you dance all your life, there's a big chance you will never see yourself as \"old\".
