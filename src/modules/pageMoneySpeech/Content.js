        A tamperproof, borderless, ownerless, global record is not just money
        and it&apos;s not just language. It&apos;s a new way of simultaneously

        are virtual, personal and free. Any community, network, business can
        create their own free money - &quot;free&quot; as in free speech, free
        radical, freely available - but NOT free as in free lunch, or free ride.
        It&apos;s not something you get for nothing. Open money is money that
        must be earned to be respected. When you issue it, you are obliged to
        redeem it - <b>your money is your word</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are all here in order to make money. The only difference is what kind
        of emphasis you place on that single word, &quot;make&quot;. Does it
        mean &quot;extract the most of someone&apos;s standard of value that you
        can get your hands on&quot;, or do you understand it more literally? We
        can actually <b>make</b> money: that is the primary capability web3
        endows us with. We only need to speak it into existence with integrity.

      <p>
        Although they share a common language arising from the twin practices of{' '}
        <Link to="/learn/module-1/playdough-protocols/#faith-and-finance">
          faith and finance
        </Link>
        , our <Link to="/learn/module-0/conversation">narratives</Link> and our{' '}
        <Link to="/learn/module-1/value/#narrative">financial records</Link>{' '}
        were clearly distinct before 2009. Consequently, there is confusion
        around the concept of &quot;free&quot; speech, because its definition
        shifts depending on the conp: story or money.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, programmable protocols that are intertwined with a shared
        record no-one owns are both stories <b>and</b> money. This collapses the
        distinction between narratives around which we organise and our record
        of societal debt. So, what happens to &quot;free&quot; speech?
      </p>
      <p>
        Meaningful communication is a balance between the fact that your{' '}
        <i>ability to speak</i> ought to be free, with the fact that you
        don&apos;t get to say whatever you please. Hence we enshrine freedom of
        speech as a constitutional good and implement error-handling for
        exceptions like hate speech and defamation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Protocols capable of processing valuable narratives, like Bitcoin and
        Ethereum, render such interpretive balancing acts unnecessary. Your
        ability to{' '}
        <Link to="/learn/module-0/money-language/#open-protocols-and-a-network-of-value">
          access the network
        </Link>{' '}
        - much like TCP/IP - is free in all senses, requiring only a connection
        that can support you speaking in the same language as your peers. Saying
        anything <i>meaningful</i> (i.e. state-changing) has a specific,
        well-defined economic cost, captured in transaction fees which accrue to
        the benefit of those who &quot;listen&quot; to what you have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some sense, it is the <b>primary benefit</b> of this new order of
        econo-linguistic network we now communicate with: everyone is
        simultaneously free to speak <i>and</i> the cost of any kind of
        meaningful speech is well-defined everywhere. We are also provided with
        a clear definition of meaning: any speech act which changes the state of
        our shared record.
      </p>
      <Heading level={2}>Regulation vs expense</Heading>
      <p>
        In blockchains, speech and execution are <i>one and the same thing</i>{' '}
        and interpretation is deterministic. The protocol has the bare minimum
        of rules required for consensus, basically: you cannot double spend a
        token. Every peer processes every transaction which passes these rules
        without fear or favour.
      </p>
      <p>
        The context is determined not by legal interpretation, but by{' '}
        <b>economics</b>. Rather than enshrining an ideal like &quot;free
        speech&quot; which we <i>agree is good</i>, certain behaviours we{' '}
        <i>agree to be malicious</i> are made prohibitively expensive. They are
        not disallowed, just economically unsustainable, in much the same way
        that prevention is better than any cure. Vitalik touches on this in his{' '}
        <Link to="/learn/module-1/understanding-ethereum/">Devcon 1 talk</Link>{' '}
        and we&apos;ll return to it again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can validate any kind of state transition you like in Eth2, but if
        it&apos;s provably malicious, your stake will get slashed.{' '}
        <Link to="/learn/module-6/serenity/#proving-stake">
          Programming penalties rather than rewards
        </Link>{' '}
        ensures that the only state transitions worth validating are those that
        maintain a meaningful consensus. It is a profound change in how we
        regulate expression.
      </p>
      <p>Again, it points at complementary opposites:</p>

        ðŸ’¡{' '}
        <b>The most effective way to free meaning is to price it correctly.</b>
      </StatusBanner>
      <Heading level={2}>Math beats bureaucracy</Heading>
      <p>
        Pricing different kinds of speech appropriately, rather than trying to
        &quot;protect&quot; a culturally-conditioned ideal, has the second-order
        cybernetic effect of better securing public goods. For instance, SSTOREs
        are a relatively expensive operation/expression because storing data on
        public networks is costly, and it is a cost borne by all of us.
        Therefore, we agree upon a gas price that incentivizes developers to
        write contracts which store the minimum possible information required
        for state-changing, meaningful transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could even say that, on freely accessible public blockchains, there
        is no such thing as free speech. There is only increasingly costly
        expression for increasingly complex kinds of meaning, with the
        incentives programmed such that the costs borne by the speaker are
        always provably more than those imposed on the community of listeners.
      </p>
      <Heading level={2}>The expanded view</Heading>
      <p>
        When we stop &quot;protecting&quot; free speech, but instead price any
        speech act according to a set of explicit consensus rules we all agree
        to follow, the space of <b>meaningful communications</b> is greatly
        expanded.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may think this unfairly favours the rich, but you&apos;d be wrong.
        We can <b>program</b> our shared ledger in any way we care to! If your
        program favours those already in power, it&apos;s because you lack
        creativity, not because of some limitation in the underlying protocol.
        Look at Gitcoin Grants and Quadratic Funding: a speech act which donates
        $1 to a cause can have nearly as great an effect as a donation two
        orders of magnitude larger, because we&apos;ve{' '}
        <Link to="/learn/module-4/liberal-radical/#optimal-gathering">
          modelled clearly the most optimal way
        </Link>{' '}
        to fund public goods.
      </p>
      <Callout>
        ðŸ’¡ When there is nothing to protect, we no longer need guards. Without
        guards, the digital world is not about captive audiences, but creative
        participation.
      </Callout>
      <Heading level={2}>Clarifying metaphors</Heading>
      <p>
        Money-as-a-programmable-protocol is &quot;spoken&quot; as hex-encoded
        data strings, which are run on and interpreted by a monolithic virtual
        machine which is everywhere and nowhere, so our metaphor can only go so
        far. Despite the descriptive limitations of natural language faced with
        such a construction, we can still be precise about the exceptions to
        free speech mentioned above and how they might be handled in a world
        which does not &quot;protect&quot; speech, but rather agrees communally
        on its cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hate speech (analogous to malicious behaviour or outright attacks on the
        network) can be more elegantly handled when you are required to have{' '}

        to speak meaningfully. If you then violate rules which are not just

        More fundamentally, this new order of communication, akin to the

        internet-connected machine and you gain immediate access to{' '}
        <b>monetary value</b>, anywhere in the world. One can even encode a

        timestamp servers (Satoshi&apos;s wording) which run money-as-a-protocol
