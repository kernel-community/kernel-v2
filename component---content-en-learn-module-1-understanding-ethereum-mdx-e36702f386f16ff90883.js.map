Modern computers are what Alan Turing called “automatic machines”, which we now know simply as Turing machines. A Turing machine is an abstract computational device devised to investigate the limits of what can be calculated. Practically, a Turing machine is an infinite length tape divided into squares with one symbol per square which tells the reader whether to go forward, backwards, or to stay put. Don't bother too much about the tape: Turing machines are an idea, a mental construct, which `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-7/perfection/\"\n      }}>{`allow us to investigate what it is possible, in principle, to calculate`}</a>{` (given that we also know maths itself is incomplete).`}</p>\n    <p>{`The truly fantastic thing is that Turing actually built a physical version of his abstract idea, and he did so to crack Enigma during World War II (interestingly, the reason he was able to is because `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-7/no-paradigm/#the-inertia-of-language\"\n      }}>{`fascist language always contains the seeds of its own destruction`}</a>{`: in this case, the phrase `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Heil Hitler`}</em>{` was a major contributing factor to Germany's defeat). Apart from the fascinating history, this is a fantastical fact because – due to the simplicity of the actual idea of a Turing machine – for any computable algorithm, a Turing machine capable of implementing that algorithm's logic can be constructed.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This means computers can be used to build computers, which gets us very close to the sort of self-replicating pattern we perceive in RNA. We can write an algorithm which specifies a computer, and then implement that as software in another computer. The first people to do this were IBM researchers in the 1970's who were looking to investigate resource consumption and needed to partition their machines to do so properly. That led to the birth of virtual machines, which are software that emulate a computer, running on other computers. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The Ethereum Virtual Machine is one such instance. What is fascinating about it in the context of all this history is that it is a “singleton” (sometimes called “monolithic”). That is, it is one, single virtual machine, running on thousands of different, distributed computers. This is interesting because, not only does it allow us to investigate the limits of what it is possible to calculate, it does so in a way which keeps us always in agreement about the current state of affairs. It achieves this by virtue of the following architecture, described more succinctly by Vitalik:`}</p>\n    <Process mdxType=\"Process\">\n      <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Stack`}</strong>{`: up to 1024 32-byte fields.  `}</p>\n      <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Memory`}</strong>{`: just an infinitely expanding byte array, but the more you expand the byte array, the more gas you have to pay. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Most of the limits aren't static, they're economic and you'll see this idea again and again.`}</em>{`  `}</p>\n      <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Storage`}</strong>{`: permanent for contracts.

He follows this with an explanation of memory-hard algorithms for mining and why they were an innovation; emphasises the fast block time (17s); and discusses \"uncles\", which solve the stale rates of blocks that arise due to network latency.
