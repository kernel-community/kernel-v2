We are stressed, overworked, locked away, confined to tiny spaces, practicing greediness.

We are trained to think and not to feel - and this duality limits our existence much before identity politics, sexuality, or class become present.`}</p>\n    <p>{`However, dancers share a privileged, if paradoxical, position within Descartes' dualism. The mind must work with the body to EMBODY the feeling, the thought, the image. Dancers spend their lifetime rigorously training not only their muscles, memory, reflexes, endurance, but also their perception, their ability to feel, and their ability to convey something bigger than them, something that belongs to our shared unconscious.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Ironically, dancers have always been under-appreciated precisely because, even though embodiment creates mysterious attraction through the eye, no one besides the dancers perceives fully what's going on! Embodied understanding only comes with practice, and training these things is not easy. It is rigorous and time-demanding. It's awkward and humiliating. It's often cringe.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Dance has been gatekeeping these ancient practices, and it has also, until now, been unable to translate its ephemerality into the digital world. But that is changing - technology is evolving, and slowly it is starting to behold more completely the complexity of movement (i.e. volumetric capture).`}</p>\n    <p>{`Neuroscientists have discovered different nervous processes that dance directly influences. For example, dance halts the aging process of the brain itself, so if you dance all your life, there's a big chance you will never see yourself as \"old\". We go to clubs, take drugs and dance for endless hours, exorcising our demons; or if you're more vanilla, you do a Zumba class at 9am and have a big grin the whole day.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There's something about dance and movement that makes us happy and healthy - so why aren't we applying it to our DAOs, our companies, our communities?`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"dance-as-future-technology\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}>{`Dance as Future Technology`}<a parentName=\"h2\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#dance-as-future-technology\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"dance as future technology permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor-link after\"\n      }}><span parentName=\"a\">{`¶`}</span></a></h2>\n    <p>{`When I entered the web3 world, I couldn't even sit still in a chair, and my eyes hurt when they looked into the screen.
