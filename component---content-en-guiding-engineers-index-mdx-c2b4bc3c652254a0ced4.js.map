It's explicitly meant to be easy for engineers to extend. KERNEL is about serving the continued creation of free money, and this requires that the tools we use are openly accessible and can be used without permission.

You'll also learn how to leverage the design system - `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/makerdao/dai-ui\"\n      }}>{`DAI-UI`}</a>{` - to build slick, smooth and optimised user interfaces with minimal effort.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It's great to speak the language of online community building, but one needs solid technical foundations on which to build truly transformative ways of interacting and relating.

Once you've seen how easy it is to work with our technical community tools, we hope you'll fall down the rabbit hole and begin to figure out the deeper architectural challenges and intricacies of what \"free money\" might really mean for all of us.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
