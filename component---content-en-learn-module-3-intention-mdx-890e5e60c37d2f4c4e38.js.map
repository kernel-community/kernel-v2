This nuance leads us not to `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`veritas`}</em>{` (the Latin word for \"trust\", from which we get the focus on verification), but `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`treysta`}</em>{`, meaning \"stable\" or \"reliable\": that is, given the same inputs, the contract will return the same result over and over again forever.
