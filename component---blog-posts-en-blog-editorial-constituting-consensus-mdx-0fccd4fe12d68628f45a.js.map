It does not have much impact on our day to day life.`}</p>\n    <p>{`However, “constitution” also means the composition of something: it is a recipe for how we can most harmoniously live together given the basic bits which make each of us up (`}<em parentName=\"p\">{`statuere`}</em>{` comes from the Latin meaning “made up” and `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`con`}</em>{` is a prefix which means “together”). The word itself displays the heart of human being: each one of us is a unique composition of constituent parts which can only be fully understood - can only cohere - when we come together.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In Africa, we say `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu`}</em>{`: a human being is only a human being through other human beings. This, too, is a law. Though it is not a law in the sense that we understand “constitution”. It is simply an observed and lived aspect of reality, passed down and reproduced anew in every different age.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In this older sense, a constitution is really a dynamic and living tradition tailored over countless generations, designed to lead you to useful knowledge about who you really are and the harmony in which you are composed. Any tradition is only useful insofar as it can train you to live in accordance with `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`your`}</em>{` constitution. Doing so sincerely brings you to the great truth of every human life and tradition: how you are made up is no different from the constitution of every other being, indeed, from every aspect which appears in the universe. There is no separation. The essence of each and every constituent part is `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://youtu.be/iYNGS2CZnfM?t=615\"\n      }}>{`nothing other than the whole`}</a>{`.

The question is, “If all is One and my constitution reflects the same essential nature of every aspect of the universe, then why have a formal constitution at all?”. Well, because this sentence “It is One” is not the truth. It is a metaphor which only hints at the truth of an experience which cannot be put in words, because it is the ground of all words and meaning. The most we can do in terms of tailoring traditions capable of grooming and preparing people for such experience is to speak in the negative.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I cannot say what Reality, or Truth, is. I can only be honest about what aspects of my experience seem to deviate from It. If I carve away clearly all that is not essential, what I am left with - the radiant, infinite, eternal void at the heart of life - is what is referred to in metaphors like `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`tat tvam asi`}</em>{` or “It is One” or “Great Spirit”. The most harmonious external constitution to abide by follows this same pattern of simple negation:`}</p>\n    <p>{`Do not kill. Do not lie. Do not covet. Do not do to others what you would not want done to you.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This, and no more, is the basis for a wholly constituted life. Why not include positive prescriptions like “love thy neighbour”? Because love is already the expression of our essential nature. Telling a human being to love is like telling water to be wet. If you simply stop doing all that is not directed by the love which already constitutes you, this becomes obvious.`}</p>\n    <p>{`What about stealing and cheating and other social ills? Well, that’s the point: these are `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`social ills`}</em>{` and so we can compose societal incentive structures that make them `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-2/money-speech/#math-beats-bureaucracy\"\n      }}>{`mathematically impossible`}</a>{` or `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-6/censorship-resistance/#economic-proof\"\n      }}>{`prohibitively expensive`}</a>{`.
