He describes:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`\"how collectibles lowered transaction costs in each kind of wealth transfer â€“ in the voluntary\nfree gift of inheritance, in voluntary mutual trade or marriage, and in the involuntary\ntransfers of legal judgments and tribute `}{`[...]`}{` Durable collectibles, what today we would call\nheirlooms, could persist for many generations and added substantial value at each transfer â€“\noften making the transfer even possible at all.\"`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`We'll be exploring this idea later in the course through the context of gifts, which we feel\nprovide another, perhaps more profound, level of understanding to these types of transactions,\nbut Szabo's argument about lowered transaction costs is nevertheless well worth reflecting on.\nHe goes on to provide a most fascinating example: the Kula trading network of pre-colonial\nMelanesia.

For example, food is\nworth much more to starving people than to well-fed ones. However, the trust required to make\nthe requisite trades was often lacking between tribes, and so collectibles substituted for\notherwise necessary but non-existent long-term trust relationships. In tandem with this kind of\n\"starvation insurance\", Szabo advances a theory of trade-based predation - pointing out that\nmany palaeolithic tribes specialized in hunting only one kind of species, which often migrated\nseasonally, i.e. reindeer or bison. Importantly:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`\"It is not enough, for the theory of collectibles put forth in this paper to be correct, that\nsingle beneficial trades were possible.
