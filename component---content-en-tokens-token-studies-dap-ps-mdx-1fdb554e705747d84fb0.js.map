Hence, this contract does mint \"votes\": they remain only as mathematical fictions used to determine the cost of voting.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This means we can leverage what is actually interesting about bonding curves (i.e. that they are powerful ways to program money with incentives that would otherwise not be possible to create) without introducing mental overhead for people using the system: all they see is an upvote and a downvote button and a cost associated with each action, which is then directly reflected in the DApp they're voting on.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"mathematics\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}>{`Mathematics`}<a parentName=\"h2\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#mathematics\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"mathematics permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor-link after\"\n      }}><span parentName=\"a\">{`¬∂`}</span></a></h2>\n    <p>{`The more SNT you stake, the more virtual \"votes\" can be created on your DApp, so the cheaper each vote becomes.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is possible to do because the ICO Status ran set the total amount of SNT that will ever be minted, so we can use this to calculate the (exponential) rate at which \"votes\" are created based on the SNT staked relative to the Total SNT ever minted.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\"><strong parentName=\"p\">{`total_snt_minted = 68048701.74`}</strong></p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`I defined a critical concept, called the \"ceiling\", which is the % of Total SNT ever minted any one DApp can stake to rank.

However, given that the design led me to this notion of a ceiling, and I was able to prove to myself that there was no good way to predict what a \"good\" ceiling would be indefinitely into the future, I felt that it was necessary to create an \"owner\" role and give it the very specific and limited role of only being able to change the ceiling in the event that the price of SNT in USD terms (or whatever becomes the dominant measure hundreds of years from now) fluctuates drastically. `}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`This is ultimately a trade-off between technical security (maximized without any privileged role) and financial security (increased when the curve can respond to external factors and people's perception of what value is, and what is valuable).`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`Having covered the background necessary to understand what humility in design means at a practical level, we can now point out that there are some values of the ceiling which result in significantly lower values for Votes Minted. This is not significant enough, in my opinion, to fix the ceiling at a specific value forever (I don't trust my model that far), but those values do represent local minima for Votes Minted.
