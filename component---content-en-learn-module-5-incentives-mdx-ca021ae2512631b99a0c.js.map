We wish to emphasise that this three-pronged scheme can be used to generate a great deal more economic nuance than \"win/loss\". Ethereum 2.0 is a living example of a protocol which acknowledges much of the nuance around participation: very often you may be at odds with the majority, but by being aware of this and designing for it, we can make space for it and create novel economic mechanisms (like the \"`}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://eth2book.info/latest/part2/incentives/inactivity\"\n      }}>{`inactivity leak`}</a>{`\") which solve for our security needs.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This line of thinking builds on what Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen described as a \"`}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Economics.ipynb\"\n      }}>{`new kind of economic essay`}</a>{`\" that was programmed by Peter Norvig. In a few lines of Python, Norvig proves a surprising result about wealth inequality. The long-term distribution of wealth is primarily defined by the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`nature of the `}<a parentName=\"em\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"/learn/module-4/self-enquiry/#signature-performances\"\n        }}>{`transactions`}</a></em>{`. It's not the initial distribution of wealth or geographic distribution of agents that counts, it's whether there are transactions which are not only win/loss. It's whether there is nuance, space for generative collaboration, \"good\" credit (i.e. credit used to create rather than only consume), and win/win interactions.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Wealth inequality has to do primarily with the nature of the economic protocols we use to create and distribute value. This doesn't mean we can turn a blind eye to historic injustice, but it does suggest that there are ways of solving problems of inequality that focus more on the process and less on specific amounts distributed at specific times to specific groups (although that may be an additional and effective short-term solution for reasons of psychology, social cohesion or other factors not considered in Norvig's essay).`}</p>\n    <p>{`The larger point is this: if you disagree that the initial distribution of wealth doesn't affect long-run wealth inequality, you can try to find a counterexample: an initial distribution which does affect inequality. You can experiment by making modifications to a few lines of code, trying to find instances where the initial distribution matters. No matter whether you succeed or fail, you will build a better understanding of the problem.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Used well, Jupyter notebooks can be environments for transformative thought. They're a new media form, with different possibilities from either essays or code. And that's just a notebook, let alone a smart contract. Smart contracts deployed on a shared, global network not only demonstrate new economic insights and ideas, they `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`implement`}</strong>{` them. We can even design consensus protocols, within which smart contracts live, which respond to the nature and extent of our participation (in terms of penalties, rewards and inactivity leaks, but also in terms of the monetary policy of the network: high activity on Ethereum means a deflationary supply, as more fees get burnt than validator rewards get minted, whereas low activity results in n inflationary supply). `}</p>\n    <p>{`Ethereum 2.0 is an example of an intentionally crafted shared environment, which quantifies what is \"correct\" in a given context, ensuring it where possible and incentivising it where we cannot be certain.

However, it does drive the price of carbon credits up, which makes it more expensive for companies who pollute to offset such behaviour. Mechanisms are not only about whom we reward and how: we only favour that way of thinking due to the way incentives are programmed in Proof of Work blockchains, and because rewards are easier to market to the masses.
