The idea is to use the flashcards to build a spaced repetition memory system, so that it is easy for you to remember everything you learn in Kernel.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The flashcards are not examination questions!

We take that DAI and put it into a yield-bearing protocol for you. Completing all the cards should take a few months from when you sign up. At the end of that period, whether you have completed them successfully or not, you can claim your DAI back. `}</p>\n    <p>{`If you chose to mint LEARN tokens with your fee, which guarantee you access to Kernel forever, we'll add the yield to your amount minted. If you just claim the DAI back because you don't want to be a part of the community, we'll give you your full fee back, but keep any yield you earned for maintenance and improvement of our courses.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
