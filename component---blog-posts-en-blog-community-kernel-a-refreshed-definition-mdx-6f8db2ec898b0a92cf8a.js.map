It also ensures that future blocks are shaped by previous ones in a more and more decentralized manner. Blocks are a special time, so we don’t expect Fellows to want or need them constantly.

Wealth, for most Fellows, goes beyond the financial, and means ‘having enough to share.’ They come from 50 countries and represent a variety of top universities, companies, and institutions, but transcend their labels too, leaving them at the door during Kernel. They have vocations as diverse as circus director, (bestselling) author, (Bollywood) actor, ecologist and nature guide, documentary filmmaker, musician, and anthropologist. Kernel being a technology program, there are an incredible number of talented software engineers, designers, and internet natives. 40% of us belong to underrepresented groups. When we’re together, there’s always new surprises and unexpected commonalities to uncover.`}</p>\n      </Box>\n      <Box mdxType=\"Box\">\n        <p><strong parentName=\"p\"><em parentName=\"strong\">{`Internal transformation`}</em></strong>{` `}</p>\n        <p>{`When describing the Kernel syllabus above, we mentioned the personal aspect of our study, which may have led to a confused pause. What does technology have to do with our personal lives? Technology has an undeniable influence over us. It amplifies our internalities and how we relate to each other, for better or worse. For open-source, peer-to-peer networks based on consensus, perhaps even more so. Building a better web and becoming better humans are two sides of the same coin. What does bettering yourself mean to us? Simply that you’re honing your innate strengths and aligning your service to those gifts. Your path is only yours, and Kernel helps you find it.`}</p>\n      </Box>\n      <Box mdxType=\"Box\">\n        <p><strong parentName=\"p\"><em parentName=\"strong\">{`A refuge from market cycles and speculation `}</em></strong></p>\n        <p>{`Two things often heard in the bigger crypto world right now are, “Where has crypto’s initial ethos gone?” and “Those still around in a bear market are those who really care.” Kernel is beautifully insulated — not because these swings don’t affect us, but because relationships are the antidote to feelings of overwhelm. Amidst the cyclical nature of crypto, values like decentralization and positive sum/infinite games have always been, still are, and will continue to be front and center for Kernel. As a result, a lot of crypto’s ups and downs, both toward FOMO or FUD, are kept more clear.`}</p>\n      </Box>\n    </Process>\n    <p>{`Kernel is many things: an experience, an education, a long conversation, a community. An underground stream feeding intentional people and projects. A place for honesty, trust, excellence, clarity, and heightened awareness. A place to practice, serve, and care for one another. The search for truth, the chance to speak it with love, and an act of remembrance: that we are who we are through others, and others are themselves through us.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\"><strong parentName=\"p\"><em parentName=\"strong\">{`Kernel applications close December 1, 2023.
