Do I have to agree to the whole text? Does it make me a co-creator or co-beneficiary? Or is it more like a clap, or a like? `}</p>\n    <p>{`While it is certainly closer to endorsement than co-creation in our context, a signed message links permanently your public key to some data. We have always liked the analogy that your public key is like your home address (and can be shared), while your private key is like your bathroom door key (don’t share it ever). If we extend this analogy, then signed messages are like what you choose to plant in your front garden. As opposed to claps, which can only be seen on Medium, every time someone passes your home on the chain, they’ll be able to see what you’re growing there, irrespective of the media in which they encounter it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The declaration was initially designed to use social verification, which we decided not to implement.

However, it is also the method which allows for the most choice of the three possible interactions, because the price is left open to readers to specify by using a slider. The price you choose to pay for one of these seals also determines the shape of the seal that gets created. The more you pay, the more edges the seal has; moving from square to hexagonal to circular.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Critically, this explicitly financial interaction has only one effect: all funds are spent on free(ing) education. We feel this makes for a strangely recursive loop, the likes of which could help fund public goods sustainably across our ecosystems. Creating a seal is a public and verifiable commitment to a simple idea: free education matters, in the sense of both cost and autonomy - which is something the mechanism by which these seals are minted mirrors.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We have a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-1/playdough-protocols\"\n      }}>{`long-running interest in seals`}</a>{`.

In particular, we were inspired by the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://app.rewilder.xyz\"\n      }}>{`Rewilder`}</a>{` team. However, when we looked at their contracts, we noticed that `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/maraoz/rewilder/blob/dapp/contracts/RewilderNFT.sol#L29\"\n      }}>{`they use their own api`}</a>{` and became determined to do better.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are two ways immediately available for improving this.

We know we could have made it much more gas efficient by storing the URI in a tokenURI() function that overrides the ERC721 standard, which would be view only. However, we want to be able to update the seals over time, which means pointing the baseURI for metadata to a different Arweave URL. It is therefore critical that we store the full string in each tokenURI, so that seals which have already been minted remain fixed, while new seals can be generated with a different season of images and text.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This allows us to explore ongoing, sustainable, seasonal interaction with the contract and with the wider web3 community. It also allows us to play with limits and constraints which are not contrived. That is: there is no limit to the number of seals which can be minted, because 10000 PFP campaigns cultivate the kind of consumerist culture we find to be boring and distasteful.`}</p>\n    <p>{`However, everyone’s time is limited. It is not limited by some human contrivance in a structure we have designed and created: it is limited in an existential way. Therefore, placing a time limit on how long these particular seals will be created allows us to generate the kind of motivation to mint you might see in other projects, with less unnecessary anxiety and FOMO. We say this because seasonality implies not only change, by `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`cyclicality`}</strong>{`.

Anybody could call the mint function, provide it with any string, and it would create a NFT with the tokenURI set to that string. `}</p>\n    <p>{`We knew the web app could send strings which referred to images generated using the text, and that we could exclude all other NFTs not minted in this manner from the “`}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://sign.kernel.community/signatures\"\n      }}>{`Soul Signs`}</a>{`” page. There is a difference between `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`contractual reality`}</em>{` - which everyone has access to and can do with as they please; and `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`social reality`}</em>{` - in which we can present curated data most relevant to our community and context through various interface choices.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This, at least, was the argument we presented to the wonderful developer who audited the contracts. With deep experience in the world of NFTs, this developer made the point that having an open and permissionless mint function was all well and good until a troll comes along and uses it to mint horrific and illegal content, which then results in your collection getting banned from secondary markets. `}</p>\n    <p>{`While such markets are not the major focus of our work, it would be a pity to have done all this only to get banned for someone else’s actions. In addition to this, we have implemented a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/kernel-community/signature-economies/blob/main/packages/hardhat/contracts/base/ERC2981ContractWideRoyalties.sol\"\n      }}>{`10% contract-wide royalty`}</a>{` for secondary sales of Signature NFTs, so getting banned from marketplaces will likely lose us some potentially useful revenue in the long term.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"better-ways-of-being-open\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}>{`Better Ways of Being Open`}<a parentName=\"h2\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#better-ways-of-being-open\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"better ways of being open permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor-link after\"\n      }}><span parentName=\"a\">{`¶`}</span></a></h2>\n    <p>{`Initially, we discussed the possibility of only allowing the creator of the contract to mint Signature NFTs. However, this defeats the whole point of permissionless systems, and introduces a potentially catastrophic security breach if the keys for that creator account are ever compromised. `}</p>\n    <p>{`So, we decided to add a “signer” account to the contract, separate from the creator. Though anyone could call mint(), the signer account would have to sign any message sent to that function, which now included a data param for that signed message, and which would fail if it had not been signed correctly. Trying to have our cake and eat it too, we made sure that we could `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/kernel-community/signature-economies/blob/cb38481ad4d5a21b32ff618abb3b92eede80e52a/packages/hardhat/contracts/SignatureNFT.sol#L86\"\n      }}>{`set the signer account to 0x0`}</a>{` if we wanted, in which case it would be equivalent to a purely public function. The thinking here was, “permissionless, but not unmoderated”.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This seemed to be an OK solution: not wonderful, but workable given our time constraints.`}</p>\n    <p>{`However, when we began working it into the web app, we saw how much unnecessary complexity this simple change at the contractual level added to the overall project. It required running a separate server somewhere which had the signer private key on it, then authenticating calls to that server, as well as the data in those calls, trying to obfuscate network requests made from the frontend (not really possible) and many other things which any “authentication” paradigm necessarily implies.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It was a deep lesson in why passwords and privileged roles suck. `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch07.html\"\n      }}>{`Richard Stallman`}</a>{` was heard laughing loudly in the background of many of those late nights.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We returned to the drawing board. We needed some way of minting NFTs which was flexible enough to accommodate reader’s choices, but constrained enough that trolls would not use it to get our collection banned. We knew we could not use any kind of privileged account. The thought of trying to use the same technique as is outlined above for Sealed NFTs did cross our minds, but the number of different combinations of characters in a 2124 word essay is well over 2 million using the most optimistic of counts, and crafting all of that metadata was too much.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Instead, we decided that all we needed to record when readers minted a Signature NFT was the start and end indices of the characters they had chosen. We could then use these start and end numbers to somehow generate the beautiful image you now see. `}</p>\n    <p>{`However, we had already written the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/kernel-community/signature-economies/blob/main/packages/dapp/src/components/HighlightModal/Canvas.js\"\n      }}>{`p5.js script`}</a>{` which generates those images and had grown quite attached to it.

That, too, was not something we felt capable of doing. However, onchain svgs do use a trick we could leverage: a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/kernel-community/signature-economies/blob/main/packages/hardhat/contracts/SignatureNFT.sol#L114\"\n      }}>{`tokenURI() override function`}</a>{` that returns metadata directly from the contract using base64 encoded json.
