These evolved into religious myths around the time of the agricultural revolution. It's no coincidence that, concomitant with the spread of the first major religious myths, came the development of writing; the primary use of which was tracking debt. Myth alone is not enough to hold societies larger than your average tribe together: it needs to be paired with a shared record, built around succinct and significant symbols.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Our ability to create value has always been tied to the ways in which we tell stories about, and with, our shared records`}</strong>{`. However, prior to the feedback loop outlined in `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-0/trust\"\n      }}>{`trust`}</a>{`, the record was maintained by `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`someone`}</em>{`, which gives them enormous power and means everyone else is incentivized to try and manipulate them.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Because blockchains allow us to define succinctly our shared truths, `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`and because the record itself is shared`}</strong>{` across all participants, there is a whole new \"trust space\" we can explore, searching for more valuable kinds of transactions impossible within merely legal fictions. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Take a moment to reflect on this paradox: trustless media enable us to trust each other directly.
