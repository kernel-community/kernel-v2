Your role as guide or host is `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`to listen with fine attention`}</strong>{`. It is the quality of your listening which will move the overall conversation closer to shared truth. It is `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`not`}</strong>{` about what you can share or teach. Put all of those desires and impulses away and simply show up with the intention to learn as much as you can.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Kernel conversations are not a platform for you, your product, or your organization. They are not one-to-many broadcasts, no matter how important what you know might seem to you. They are `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`shared explorations`}</strong>{` of the truth outside ourselves and they can only come from a deep and lived honesty about that which we know and that which we wish to know.`}</p>\n    <p>{`So, in preparing for a conversation, it is important to bring into your awareness just how much you do not currently know. When you speak from that place - with the humility, honesty, and humour it naturally engenders - you invite others to share authentically and we guarantee that you will be amazed at the unexpected shapes your conversations take.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Finally, when in the conversation itself, simply trust that whatever is unfolding is valuable even if it doesn't appear to you as such in the moment. In fact, when someone says something which you disagree with or don't follow, it is a `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`great gift`}</strong>{`, because it gives you the opportunity to examine in detail your own resistances and bias. When you find yourself nervous, confused, confronted or frustrated, try your best to take a few deep breaths, settle your attention once more in your heart, remember that you are here to learn, and then ask another question. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Asking questions from a place of neutral curiosity is what can bring people to answers they themselves weren't fully aware of before the conversation and - trust us - that is the greatest gift you can give another human being. We're not trying to transmit our own knowledge in these spaces, we're trying to help each person come to their own realisation of that which they already are and already know, because that is what the First People's greeting is really about:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`Tsamkwa /tge? `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Are your eyes nicely open?`}</em><br parentName=\"p\"></br>{`\n`}{`Kiri kwa /tge. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`My eyes are nicely open.`}</em></p>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
