That is: if we measure the \"price\" of crypto in terms of US Dollars, then the \"price\" of crypto changes wildly and regularly. `}</p>\n    <p>{`If we choose the Dolllar as our measure, then we need a way to hold cryptocurrencies without being constantly exposed to abrupt changes in the market. We need a way to \"peg\" a token to the unit we choose to measure in - i.e. USD - without that way depending on a single group of people (as it does in the case of Tether). MakerDAO made this possible with the creation of DAI. The underlying idea is fairly simple: `}</p>\n    <Process mdxType=\"Process\">\n    \nLock up your ETH as \"collateral\" in a contract. \n      <p>{`That contract will issue you with DAI, but is programmed to be \"overcollateralized\": i.e. you always have to lock up more ETH than the DAI you'll get in return.`}</p>\n      <p>{`A system of oracles (run by different people) tells that contract what the current price of ETH is in terms of USD, and you have to make sure you maintain a healthly \"collateralization ratio\". Which means: if the price of ETH falls, you need to add more ETH; if the price of ETH rises, you can claim more DAI for the same amount of collateral.`}</p>\n      <p>{`If the price of DAI as it is traded on secondary markets rises above $1, anyone can lock their ETH up and create DAI for $1 in the contract, then sell it on the open market for a profit.`}</p>\n      <p>{`If the price of DAI falls below $1, you can buy it on the market, exchange it for ETH, and redeem your position more cheaply than you would otherwise be able to. Both of these together are called \"arbitrage trading\" or \"arbing\".`}</p>\n      <p>{`So, because the contract is programmed to give you DAI for your ETH, at a rate determined by the price it receives from the oracles, there is an incentive for people to \"arb\" DAI whenever it moves away from its peg. The more people do this, the more quickly the price will return to $1. `}</p>\n      <p>{`In this manner, we have a decentralized mechanism that anyone can use, the result of which is the maintenance of a \"stablecoin\": a digital token which tracks a unit of value that exists outside the specific order of events we all subscribe to on chain.`}</p>\n    </Process>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"why-be-stable\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}>{`Why Be Stable?`}<a parentName=\"h2\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#why-be-stable\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"why be stable permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor-link after\"\n      }}><span parentName=\"a\">{`¶`}</span></a></h2>\n    <p>{`Stability is a genuinely rich phenomenon to explore, because it presupposes that there is something stable in the world of space and time. The US Dollar has lost 86% of its value since 1971 alone, so the irony of using it as a measure of \"stability\" is easy enough to establish.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When Maker was being created, there was (and still is) endless discussion about using other pegs, like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other indices and/or baskets of assets or commodities which may be ideologically more neutral and/or proven to be less inflationary over time.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For all the good theory in many of those debates, the facts of psychology play a seemingly primary role. We can point out the arbitrariness of the Dollar, or its inflationary nature, or the way it is governed by unelected bureaucrats, or the track record they have for handling complexity; but it doesn't change the fact that it is still the reserve currency of the world and that most people still use it to pay for what they perceive to be the most important goods and services in their lives.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is why token engineering, in the final analysis, is not primarily about code. It is about the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`intergenerational cultural work being done to shift our collective perception`}</strong>{` of what is most important; that is, to change our minds - collectively - about what and how we value.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Clearly, doing all this work simply to peg a token back to the Dollar - a measure the hegemony of which we're collectively trying to break - is fraught with contradiction. However, it is also an understandable \"stepping stone\": a necessary compromise with the collective psychology of people alive today. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Remember, the tools and process for establishing a digital representation of a measure of value which exists beyond the chain itself have been created. `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`This is an incredible fact`}</strong>{`.

Surely a lot of people's positions will become undercollateralized? And what happens to the stability of the overall system of contracts in this case?`}</p>\n    <p>{`Firstly, if your position drops below 150% collateralization - that is, if you have drawn more than two thirds of the current Dollar value of ETH you locked up - then you are liable to be liquidated and charged an automatic 13% penalty. This means the ETH you locked will be claimed by the system so that it remains solvent, along with an extra 13% fee to incentivize you to ensure this doesn't happen. If there is any ETH left over after 100% of your debt is repaid, plus the 13% fee, it is returned to you.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Nevertheless, a drop of 80% in the price of ETH relative to USD might create deeper problems than can be papered over by the liquidiation mechanism and fee above. In this case, there is a real risk that the overall system may become insolvent and DAI might permanently break its peg (given that investors might lose confidence in it and no longer be willing to make those arb trades which keep it at or around $1).`}</p>\n    <p>{`If this does happen, there is another token - called MKR - which acts as a \"lender of last resort\". There was a set number of MKR in existence at first. If the overall system becomes undercollateralized, more MKR are printed, sold on the open market, and used to pay down any bad debt. The phrase \"lender of last resort\" is traditionally used to refer to Reserve Banks like the Federal Reserve, hence Maker is often referred to as \"The Central Bank of the Internet\".`}</p>\n    <p>{`MKR is the governance token of the MakerDAO system. The fact that it also fulfills the economic function of \"lender of last resort\" is what makes MakerDAO truly remarkable. They remain one of the few organisations to create a token that plays a critical role in how the application itself functions. That is, if I hold MKR, I am `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`actually incentivized to make decisions in the interests of the protocol and therefore the people who use it`}</strong>{` because, if I don't, I stand the chance of being diluted if MKR is printed to cover bad debt.`}</p>\n    <p>{`MKR is used to `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://vote.makerdao.com/\"\n      }}>{`vote on critical parameters`}</a>{` which effect how DAI works: the kinds of collateral that may be used; the collateralization ratio for the kinds agreed to be valid; the \"debt ceiling\" for each kind (i.e. how much of that particular kind of collateral the whole system can be exposed to); the DAI Stability Fee, which is essentially an interest rate on DAI that can be levied and various other factors. MKR is also used to pass on chain votes about who may fulfill certain roles within the DAO, what sort of compensation core teams get and how that is paid, and various other non-parameter but still-critical choices.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"making-good\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}>{`Making Good`}<a parentName=\"h2\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#making-good\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"making good permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor-link after\"\n      }}><span parentName=\"a\">{`¶`}</span></a></h2>\n    <p>{`Fascinatingly, MakerDAO has evolved to `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP38\"\n      }}>{`pay some of its contributors in MKR`}</a>{`, essentially as equity for `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP25\"\n      }}>{`critical work`}</a>{` on the protocol, or business development (which is critical because of how important liquidity is for the overall stability, resilience, and security of the system).

Suffice it here to say that it removes the need to vote on lots of different collateralization ratios or debt ceilings, and so removes the need for a lot of what is described above.
