Google indexes the world’s knowledge quite well. However, the way it encourages consultation and represents the results of any search is tainted by artificial incentives. The kind of collective intelligence augmentation that Bush and Engelbart and Otlet and Ramsay were interested in is as much art as it is science, and so it is to art that we must turn to explore not just the shape of relationships between repositories in a network, but the form and pattern within each repository that makes it open in an ethical sense in addition to the open agalmia described above.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"interface\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}>{`Interface`}<a parentName=\"h2\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#interface\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"interface permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor-link after\"\n      }}><span parentName=\"a\">{`¶`}</span></a></h2>\n    <p>{`The state of the art is not actually dynamic knowledge repositories; it is `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-4/the-garden/#growing-hope\"\n      }}>{`community gardens`}</a>{`.
