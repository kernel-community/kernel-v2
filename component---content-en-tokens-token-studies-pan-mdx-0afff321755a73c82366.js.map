Well, mostly through shifts in collective perception. If more people think it is worth something - either as a store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account or some combination of those three - then the price they are willing to pay in order to attain it tends to rise. The same thinking applies to PAN: the more communities are involved, and the more each community uses PAN to perform any task within that community, the more the overall perceived value of the token rises, and the more value can flow back to the communities who use of it created that shift in perception. `}</p>\n    <p>{`It is a virtuous feedback loop (in both senses of the word \"virtue\" - ethical and cybernetic), implemented on top of an extremely simple inflationary design, which has a set limit intended to provide the psychological incentive to participate as soon as you learn about it.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"sincerity-or-manipulation\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}>{`Sincerity or Manipulation`}<a parentName=\"h2\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#sincerity-or-manipulation\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"sincerity or manipulation permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor-link after\"\n      }}><span parentName=\"a\">{`Â¶`}</span></a></h2>\n    <p>{`It's at this point where some people cry foul and accuse such thinking of being no more than a glorified ponzi scheme.
