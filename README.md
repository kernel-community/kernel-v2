# [Kernel Community](https://kernel.community)

This repo hosts the code for a new type of online learning environment, which mixes personal thinking skills with technical practices via a focus on conversation and relationality. It is part of our ongoing efforts to make learning free, in both senses.

## Getting Started

**Dependencies**

1. Yarn
2. Node v14 (we recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

```
git clone https://github.com/kernel-community/kernel-v2.git
cd kernel-v2
yarn
yarn start
```

**Codespace**

We have also created a codespace for this repository, which you should be able to use by clicking the green `Code` button above and following the codespace tab to run this directly in your browser with everything automatically set up.

Check out the `guiding` directory under `content/en` for everything you need to know about how to work with this site, from a cheatsheet and component palette, to detail about how translations, search, and navigation are handled.

## Roadmap

_The red road lies bare before us,_  
_a path of joy, and life's good water_  
_which wanders into rainbow fire_  
_as it finds its way around the four_    
_part turning harmony._  
  
_Hear, dear friends, that old vision_  
_our grandparents of the good mind gave:_  
_a hoop of many hoops woven together_  
_hoping the tree might bloom again,_  
_though there is no king who will return._  
  
_It is us_  
_who must roll in time's dust_  
_and gather the ash of past fires_  
_to help grow a garden that holds_  
_the light, and shifts it into_  
_something sweet,_  
_ripe, juicy,_  
_redemptive._
