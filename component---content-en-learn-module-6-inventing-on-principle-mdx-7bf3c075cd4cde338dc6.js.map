Then, we can start thinking of ways to change our work other than typing new code. Bret demonstrates this by \"dialling\" numbers up and down in the code editor with a simple ctrl + click mechanism, and having the effect directly reflected in the running program. This allows you to explore the space and pick the magnitude which feels best to you artistically, without needing to go through each possible number manually.
