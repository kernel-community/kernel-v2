The goal is: `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`set learning free`}</strong>{`, because student debt is iniquitous. However, educators play a critical cultural role and deserve much broader recognition (both financial and social). Can we balance both these insights?`}</p>\n    <p>{`No model can help you confront this, because the question presupposes intention, human freedom, choice, and responsibility. It is not a question of parameter optimisation. This is not to say models are unnecessary - we will present one later in this section - it is simply that `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`it is these kind of trade-offs which epitomise token engineering`}</strong>{`.
