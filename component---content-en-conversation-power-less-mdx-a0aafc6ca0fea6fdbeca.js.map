Havel means this in a subtle way, because it was clear even then that no-one really thought the powers-that-be were telling the actual truth. Havel’s point is that you don’t need to believe the ideology by which power is exercised to nevertheless propagate it. You simply need to accept the convenient truths offered to you, rather than thinking carefully about what your truth truly is. The post-totalitarian power obscured by such convenience is also exercised via “intricate and well-developed mechanisms for the direct and indirect manipulation of the entire population”, a feature with which we are all now well acquainted.`}</p>\n    <p>{`These two aspects are critical to our reflection, because they illustrate that Havel–while writing for and within a specific context–is nevertheless describing issues that are still relevant today. Moreover, when we are confronted with power that is exercised in order to manipulate or manufacture truth, the response has always been (and will always be) to live within the truth.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is critical, because the thing that Havel is most concerned about in such systems is not some specific dictator, or evil party, or conniving group of ruling elite: it is “normalization”.

Once you have met the tyrant, the martyr, the saviour, and the victim in your own self, then any kind of totalising impulse is neutralised. Knowing intimately these aspects of your identity protects you from both the hubris and despair implicit in any attempt to “save the world”. In place of such totalising dreams arises a genuine interest in, and care for, the others who make up with you this-world-as-it-is-right-now, a desire to come into more intimate and humane contact with them, and gratitude beyond words for the life we are each given to lead, challenging though it may at times appear to be.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We are who we are through others, and it is this everyday truth that is defended by anyone living within the truth, not through any special act or intention, but simply by virtue of what is.`}</p>\n    <p>{`All of this points us back to Havel’s interest in being itself, prior to any kind of politics.
