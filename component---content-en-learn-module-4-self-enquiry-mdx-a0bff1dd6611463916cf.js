This grace is often the result of a large set of seemingly contradictory notions coming together in a way which both delights, but also seems strangely familiar. Now it becomes clear that identity in web3 is not going to be ‘solved’ by some standard or service provider.

An application or platform on one of these open protocols which restricts actions based on some identifying proof is not very interesting.
