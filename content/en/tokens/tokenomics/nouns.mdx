# Meaningful Nouns

This conversation revolves around Non-Fungible Tokens for the first time in the guild. We take a look at NounsDAO, their one NFT released every day forever, the governance framework associated with it and consider together what token communities formed around non-fungible assets may look like and what it means to form an open source brand.

## Preparation

1. Read through their current proposals to get a sense for [governance revolving around NFTs](https://nouns.wtf/vote). 
2. [Shawn's thread](https://twitter.com/sdimantha/status/1439331675826114560?s=21) provides good context for everything from IP to open brands to subDAOs, which are all discussed throughout the call.

### Additional Resources

1. This article on [legitimacy](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) will provide useful context.
2. The NounsDAO monorepo is one of the best there is. The auction house is forked from Zora, the ERC721 from OpenZepellin (with some small but well thought-out and documented changes), the governance from Compound. Take a look at [this contract in particular](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/master/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV1.sol) if you're a developer.
