# Magic Maths

We were privileged enough to share a conversation with Lisa Tan, author of the popular book, _Economics and Math of Token Engineering and DeFi_. We are incredibly grateful to Ali Rizvi for being the spark that ignited this dicussion and to Rumi for being the connector behind the scenes who ensured that Lisa got invited. Please go through the resources below and enjoy a wonderful conversation.

## Prepartion

1. [Full Crowdsourced List of Tokenomics Resources](https://twitter.com/packyM/status/1493990835473551364)
2. Go through Lisa's [learning resources](https://twitter.com/lisajytan/status/1478860302708101127). 
3. You can find further instructions [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1TrFSIu1rcyLxDR0zK3LilRjma0sEbgfc) should you be looking for her book. 
4. Additionally, Ali Rizvi has been creating [chapter summaries here](https://soulbound.notion.site/Lisa-Tan-Economics-and-Math-of-Token-Engineering-and-DeFi-Fundamentals-of-Token-Economics-82c0007e81024055ae5a3ca8a24b4e14) if you would prefer to read those or an overview summary from Salim [here](https://cryptowhatever.com/topic/59/economics-and-math-of-token-engineering-and-defi-lisa-tan)

### Additional Resources

1. This article on [tokenized communities](https://forefront.mirror.xyz/LCPVlxuOHJ2yCHvL5hJ9ErCwjwvJ2-Fk1lnOyHviIPc) from sidcode is potentially useful.
2. This article on [token supply](https://every.to/almanack/tokenomics-102-digging-deeper-on-supply) from Jocelyn Ling Malan is also potentially interesting.
