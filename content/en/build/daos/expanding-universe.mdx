# Session II

The expansion pack for DAOs, Zodiac is a collection of tools built according to an open standard. The Zodiac open standard enables DAOs to act more like constellations, connecting protocols, platforms, and chains, no longer confined to monolithic designs.

We now understand why it's necessary to know about the constellation of meanings associated with cooperatives and DAOs: seeing clearly where we have come from allows us to envision where we want to go next. Now it's time to learn about how to actually navigate by these constellations ourselves.
