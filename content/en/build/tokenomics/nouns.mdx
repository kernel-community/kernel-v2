# Meaningful Nouns

Drawing on the wonderful people already present in KB5, this conversation revolves around Non-Fungible Tokens for the first time in the guild. We take a deep look at NounsDAO, their one NFT released every day forever, the governance framework associated with it and consider together what token communities formed around non-fungible assets may look like and what it means to form an open source brand.

## Prepartion

- [The Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/m5uqNsC5x0WrY3j29xscgn/Tokens-Guild%3A-NOUNS?node-id=776%3A136)
- Read through their current proposals to get a sense for [governance revolving around NFTs](https://nouns.wtf/vote). 
- [Shawn's thread](https://twitter.com/sdimantha/status/1439331675826114560?s=21) provides good context for everything from IP to open brands to subDAOs, which are all discussed throughout the call.

### Additional Resources

- This article on [legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) will provide useful context.
- The NounsDAO monorepo is one of the best there is. The auction house is forked from Zora, the ERC721 from OpenZepellin (with some small but well thought-out and documented changes), the governance from Compound. Take a look at [this contract in particular](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/master/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV1.sol) if you're a developer.
