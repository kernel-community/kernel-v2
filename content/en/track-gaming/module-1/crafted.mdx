Call it Mirrorworld or Metaverse, but it has always been a long time coming, with articles similar to this appearing every few years.

 This second article is written by David Baszucki: the CEO of Roblox, one of the gaming platforms aiming to become the Metaverse.

## Breakout Activity

For this weekend, we're inviting the Kernel Gaming Track fellows to participate in Global Game Jam 2021: the largest game creation event taking place around the globe. 

Please register at the link below:

Fellows will create a game over the weekend based on an announced theme. The theme will be announced at the start of the jam (Friday) and will be shared on Slack.

Games don't _have_ to be video games; they can be anything from a board game or a card game, as long as it adheres to the theme. It might also be a good exercise to design a game that explores Web 3 concepts.
