# The Kernel Gaming Track

## 💡 Week 0 - Brainstorm

![Week 0 Syllabus](/images/gaming-img/week-0-syllabus-brianstorm.png)

In Week 0 of the **Kernel Genesis Block**, the participants of the Gaming Guild started mapping out topics that we'll both learn and build on during the 8 week program. This is a draft syllabus based on the brainstorm. 

We envision this being a participatory community where different guild members sign up to learn about and then present on topics that interest them. Below is the format of what you need to do when you sign up for a topic:

__Format__

1. Spend time learning about your topic.
2. Document things to share with the group. This can be as simple as putting links and a few sentences describing the links in a google doc.
3. 3-5 days before our meeting send to the group your documentation (optional for the group to read) and 15 minutes of media to prepare them for your discussion. For example:
    * A medium post
    * A video
    * A game to play
4.  Be prepared to give a short presentation on the topic or lead a participatory activity.
    * E.g Power Point
    * E.g Brainstorm
5. Be prepared with questions to lead a discussion.
