## How does this fit into Kernel?

This video of Vinay Gupta will give you a grand overview of the history of computing from 
the 1960's onward, and how it applies to the economic and societal systems we have built, and 
can imagine building in and for a more sustainable future. In particular, it has been selected 
to deepen your approach to:

<Process>

Asking better questions

Understanding money and speech - their history and possible futures

Value and its various philosophies

The importance of incentives, especially in terms of the history of computer science

</Process>

It starts with time...

### 1950's & 1960's

The modern computer was created toward the end of WWII, developed as a weapon to crack Enigma. 
The link between cryptography and computation goes all the way back to the beginning. In fact, 
analogue computers were used even before that to calculate naval gunnery trajectories. 

While Vinay omits it, please remember that [the very first computers were women](https://mjosefweber.medium.com/the-first-computers-were-human-and-mostly-women-b0d9bbff5a98), 
and that those same women went on the become the very first programmers.

Demilitarized computers for business slowly came onto the market after this. They were the size 
of rooms and there was "a world market for perhaps 5 computers a year." Data was stored on punch 
cards and then 1-inch magnetic tapes. It took a room full of programmers to get a simple program 
to run.

Q: Think back to <Link to="/learn/module-1/meaning">meaning</Link>. Cryptography is so powerful, it is regulated by most governments as what kind of object?

A: Munitions.

### 1970's

This era saw the creation of SQL (Search and Query Language), which Vinay describes as

> "The extremely forceful application of mathematics to bring order to the chaos of tape machines 
[...] The SQL abstraction assumes a multidimensional cube with one tape machine per axis [...] 
An abstract algebra then allows you to specify a space within your n-dimensional cube and pull 
data out from it into something that looks like a spreadsheet. That conceptual jump was so 
revolutionary that it took people 5 years to accept that it actually worked."

### 1970 - 1990

> "The Golden Age of SQL. We took every single thing we could fit into a DB in business, or the 
wider world, and we shoved it in." 

Most importantly, the fragility of those early machines set the mindset and psychology around the 
database and so organizations became siloed in their own versions of reality which cannot easily 
speak to one another.

1984 saw the microcomputer revolution. These were robust, reasonably cheap appliances that could 
be easily maintained and repaired. One per desk was suddenly possible. In just 15 years, we went 
from complicated machinery, tapes, and room-size computers with teams of technicians to something 
on your desk. 

> "It was just as weird as what is happening now, but it was happening 'over there' because we 
hadn't yet invented the internet to bring you the news that something weird had happened with computers."

Q: Because databases cannot be easily networked, organisations which depend on them become locked into their own _\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

A: versions, reality.

### 1990's 

> "Networking that is practical for real stuff. In 1991, the notion that you could build the 
thing to read the document into the thing that got you the document was quite radical. This 
points to an important **paradigm**. In the 1970's and 80's, computing is centred around **data**. 
It's structured, rigid, formulated, tabulated etc. The web builds on a document-centric model. 
The connection between data and documents is extremely weak."

Around 1995-6, people began to realise that one day, you would be able to make money on the 
internet. However, there's no security. Doh. It's only around 1999 that we have widely deployed 
encryption standard and hence a computer capable of taking a payment from 'the internet.'

### The 2010's: Satoshi's Vision

> "More or less everything you can do on a webpage has been done to at least a first approximation. 
It is also a year after Bitcoin got started, on a mailing list run by a weird sub-culture: Cypherpunks. 
That is, people who can't tell the difference between science fiction and reality; low EQ; 
high prevalence of autism."

> "We couldn't ask what Satoshi's intention was, because Satoshi was a ghost [...] We were provided 
with an artifact which, for all intents and purposes, might have been created by a time-traveler 
and dropped. **It's that big a jump**."

Bitcoin is like the central bank of the internet. How did we go from "Hey, we can take your 
credit card info on the internet!" to "Central Bank" in such a short space of time? This is 
where capitalism and the history of computer science merge.

> "Back in early history, the databases were singular, existing in an atomic state with one DB 
per enterprise. The network existed in some relational sense between enterprises, but because 
DB's were so fragile they never spoke directly to the network because then they broke. Even if 
you did connect DBs somewhat directly, the DB encodes the worldview of the organization and 
different organizations have different worldviews, so the DBs can't speak to each other clearly."

**There were no large-scale computer-to-computer connections that allowed us to create a shared 
world view between lots of different organizations**. This is the promise of blockchains.

A "distributed database" is really something which is both like a database and like a network. 
**Everywhere there is data, there is network; and everywhere there is network, there is data**. 
So, we can build a single, shared story of reality, spread across all the machines simultaneously. 
And when it changes in one place, it changes everywhere.

> "This is such a powerful abstraction, such a powerful technology; that the first thing they 
implemented was the central bank of the internet. Can you imagine what Acts II and III are going 
to look like? **This is unimaginable strangeness**."

> "The smart contract is the third big, integrative step. First we merged the network and the 
database in a blockchain. Then, we take computer software and put it into the shared database. 
That means everyone that is connected has a copy of exactly the same program: same data, same 
code, same result."

Q: If we can distribute our databases - that is, have something which behaves both like a database and a network - we can ensure that everywhere there is data, there is network and ... ?

A: everywhere there is network, there is data.

## 2020 And Beyond

The next step is a "scaled blockchain", which really means a

> "global computing surface onto which stuff like the Internet of Things can be loaded. It takes 
all the little bits of our computing power and **turns them into a global knowledge resource** 
that manages the basic infrastructure of our society."

Most importantly for all of this unimaginable strangeness now becoming reality: distributed DBs 
don't create new political loci of control. No-one owns <Link to="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26263179-the-stack" >the stack</Link> on which society runs.

From here (21:00 onward in the video) there is lots of political and cultural stuff not relevant 
to this specific brief, though it is still worth acquainting yourself with some of the sci-fi 
titles Vinay mentions as they do play a role in the underlying culture at which this talk is pointing.
