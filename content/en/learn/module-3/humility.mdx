# 🔎 The Search for a New Humility

We've constructed our three pillar approach to taking back the web, but what is the link between 
all three that will allow them to function as one, coherent foundation for a more equitably 
connected society? The answer harks all the way back to the [play of pattern](/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern): humility.

## How does this fit into Kernel?

We need to turn back to Maria Popova and her careful digital curations in order to search for a 
new humility; to search for the kind of attitude which will allow a greater degree of clarity 
in our intentions; more sustainable kinds of personal freedom; and the sort of openness to 
old-new ideas which can help us realise the original dream of a world wide web of informed light.

> "It is my profound belief that there is only one way to achieve this: we must divest ourselves 
of our egotistical anthropocentrism, our habit of seeing ourselves as masters of the universe 
who can do whatever occurs to us. We must discover a new respect for what transcends us."

## Brief

> "The world is now enmeshed in webs of telecommunication networks consisting of millions of 
tiny threads, or capillaries, that not only transmit information of all kinds at lightning speed, 
but also convey integrated models of social, political and economic behavior. They are conduits 
for legal norms, as well as for billions and billions of dollars crisscrossing the world while 
remaining invisible even to those who deal directly with them."

What is it that blockchains actually do, if not make the invisible flows of value visible again? 
While privacy, and the very real need we have for technologies which preserve it, is beyond the 
scope of this brief - it's worth noting that public, verifiable and auditable flows of value are 
exactly what we need to engender more empathy. 

We can be sure our money gets put to the proper use, incentivising us to give more. We can 
encode economic ideals which encourage competition to be more kind, rather than to win. We can 
make visible the best parts of our humanity, rather than hiding the economics so as to race to 
the bottom of our brain stems.

> "It is a challenge to this civilization to start understanding itself as a multi­cultural and a 
multi­polar civilization, whose meaning lies not in undermining the individuality of different 
spheres of culture and civilization but in allowing them to be more completely themselves."

This is the whole secret, really. Personal freedom of expression - where [money **is** speech](/learn/module-2/money-speech) - tied into a conscious, encoded set of constraints which incentivize [optimal collective resource allocation](/learn/module-4/liberal-radical/#capitalizing) can set individuals free to build sustainable, valuable communities.

> "I have not lost hope because I am persuaded again and again that, lying dormant in the deepest 
roots of most, if not all, cultures there is an essential similarity, something that could be 
made­ if the will to do so existed –­ a genuinely unifying starting point for that new code of 
human co­-existence that would be firmly anchored in the great diversity of human traditions."

Recall Vannevar Bush - the whole story revolves around how we collect, store, and consult our 
shared record. If we can do so collaboratively and in ways which use the differences in our 
trails to understand that which is essentially similar, then there will always be cause for hope.

Q: **Hope is a unifying starting point**, for it allows us to navigate diversity without forgetting what lies at the root of all cultures: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

A: essential similarity.

As Maria suggests, "any real movement toward healing the ruptures of our natural 
interconnectedness lies not in reverting to ancient religions but in integrating the 
achievements of reason with the core values of the human spirit."

> "Only a dreamer can believe that the solution lies in curtailing the progress of civilization 
in some way or other. The main task in the coming era is something else: a radical renewal of 
our sense of responsibility. Our conscience must catch up to our reason, otherwise we are lost."

A long section on the role of politicians follows which might not seem relevant to this course, 
or our goals - one of which could be read as removing entirely the need for politicians, given 
their abject failure across the globe to live up to Havel's standards. However, politics is 
*implicit* in any interaction between human beings, and the tools we're building on contain 
overtly political statements, so Havel's claim that the responsibility of politicians "is 
something quite different: to assume their **share of responsibility** for the long-­range 
prospects of our world and thus to set an example for the public in whose sight they work" is, 
actually, directly relevant to the technicians of a new web.

> "After all, politics is a matter of servicing the community, which means that it is morality 
in practice [...] Pride is precisely what will lead the world to hell. I am suggesting an 
alternative: humbly accepting our responsibility for the world [...]

> "I have been given to understand how small this world is and how it torments itself with 
countless things it need not torment itself with if people could find within themselves a little 
more courage, a little more hope, a little more responsibility, a little more mutual 
understanding and love."
