# 🌐 Take Back the Web

Why did the initial visions for the world wide web not work out quite as their inventors 
intended? It seems that it boils down to the incentives for building it. In some ways, you can 
consider the last 3 weeks to have been an extended consideration of how we might alter the 
incentive structures on which our society runs using global, borderless, ownerless protocols 
for money.

You've been led through how to think about a vastly interconnected world, and can reason 
coherently about critical concepts like [trust](/learn/module-0/trust), [value](/learn/module-1/value), [meaning](/learn/module-1/meaning), [money and speech](/learn/module-2/money-speech). It's time to apply these ideas to the ultimate problem: how to free the shared record of human knowledge from closed, rent-seeking corporations and extricate ourselves from an extractive attention economy. 

## Humble Cure-ations

Now that we understand the foundational concepts mentioned above, it's time to look a little 
deeper into the human stack. We cannot hope to succeed where the giants on whose shoulders we 
stand failed, if we do not understand our own intentions and what freedom really means to each 
one of us.

Incentives are a technical problem which can be consciously engineered and secured with 
deterministic, auditable, and shared code. However, we still have to know _why_ we encode 
certain incentives and not others. This goes to the heart of what kind of reality you want to 
participate in, and what kinds of freedom you genuinely feel are worth speaking into being.

While the crafted reading explores these abstract concepts, the curated material this week 
grounds itself in a mix of history and the most cutting-edge thought to make a simple argument 
about what "taking back the web" means in a practical sense. We'll develop three core pillars, 
and then bring it back to Week 0, and our original emphasis on humility. The three pillars we'll focus on this week are:

<Process>

Augmenting our ability to think for ourselves

Reclaiming our time 

Extending our ability to cooperate

</Process>

Please enjoy.
