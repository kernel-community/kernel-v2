# Remember

<Aligner center sx={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>
"The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think."
</Aligner>

Now that we understand the importance of intention and the conscious acceptance of constraints 
as that which breeds personal freedom, we can present our thesis for the week:

**Taking back the web has to do with three fundamental pillars:** 

<Process>

Augmenting our ability to think for ourselves

Reclaiming our time 

Extending our ability to cooperate

</Process>

To establish our first pillar, we'll mix a Vannevar Bush essay from 1945 and a 2019 essay from 
Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen:

## How does this fit into Kernel?

We must be clear on what "taking back the web" means. The internet came with grand dreams, 
though we're mostly stuck with artificial social spaces, overwhelming algorithms, and extractive 
**incentives** which are mining our attention as a means of propping up a failing economy.

These two essays draw out a common thread of thought stretched across 74 years in order to 
illustrate what sorts of **freedom** are actually on offer in this world wide web of ours. 
Since 1945, one critical feature has revolved around constructing new media for free and 
creative thought.

At first it may seem unrelated to blockchains, but tools for thought are public goods and 
suffer from the same problem of incentives as all other public goods. They are thus the perfect 
example of common patterns for humanity which require us to understand why programming regenerative incentives matters, and what economic code can _really_ be used to achieve in the long-term.

> **"The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but 
for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected."**

## Brief

We'll be taking great liberties by summarizing these seminal essays extensively, so we recommend 
you take the time to read them in full. There is no substitution for knowing your roots, or 
observing closely how the branches grow today.

Bush is writing as Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development at the end of 
World War II. His aim is to interrogate what all the scientists will do once the war is over. He urges 
scientists to take on the massive task of making more **accessible** our bewildering store of 
knowledge. This is about a new relationship between thinking humans and the sum of what we know. 
He begins with an idea we will return to with Juan Benet: **cooperation**.

> "The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, 
have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective 
partnership [...] They have been part of a great team. Now, as peace approaches, one asks where 
they will find objectives worthy of their best."

### Free yourself to work together

Pointing out that science has given us increased control over our environment, improved how we 
meet our basic needs, boosted health (mental and physical), extended lifespans, provided swift 
communications and allowed us to create a record of ideas that endures beyond any one individual 
life, Bush comes to the central problem we still face today:

> "There is a growing mountain of research [but we] cannot find time to grasp, much less to 
remember, all the conclusions of others as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly 
necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly 
superficial [...] 

> "The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and 
variety of present day interests, but rather that **publication has been extended far beyond 
our present ability to make real use of the record**."

This is Bush's central theme, and it is timeless. We discussed how the record we use for 
establishing our shared history and for recording our transactions 
became [one and the same thing](/learn/module-2/money-speech/#magic-internet-meaning) in 2009, 
but we have yet to attend to this central question: *how can we best consult it*?

The technology of the 1940's was very different, and Bush spends much time discussing the rise 
of complex machinery with interchangeable parts which could serve reliably, then the advances 
in photography and facsimile transmission, followed by the advances in voice recording. He uses 
these to imagine a world where scientists walk around with a camera on their head, recording 
their observations (both verbal and visual) and storing these on **microfilm**, which is the 
core technology he uses to spool out the rest of his ideas.

> "A record, if it is to be useful to science, must be **continuously extended**, it must be 
**stored**, and above all it must be **consulted**."

> "[Using microfilm] the *Encyclopædia Britannica* could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. 
A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk [...] Compression is 
not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it [...] 
Compression is important, however, when it comes to costs. The material for the microfilm 
Britannica would cost a nickel, and it could be mailed anywhere for a cent."

<Card>

Q: Even in 1945, it was not enough to make our shared records accessible. We need to figure out how to best use them. To be truly useful, a record must possess what three features?

A: Continuous extension, efficient storage, *collaborative means of consultation*.

</Card>

</Flash>

Section 4 is about mechanization of the repetitive processes of thought which, to Bush, includes 
advanced analysis because creative thinking is concerned only with the selection of data and the 
process to be employed. The manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence can be 
relegated to machines. Our technology must allow users

> "to **free their brains** for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in 
accordance with established rules [...] A mathematician is not one who can readily manipulate 
figures [...] S/he is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a 
high plane, capable of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes employed."

Section 5 begins with the manipulation of logical processes beyond arithmetic and then dives 
into the final and most critical part of the human record: **consultation**.

### Selecting the trail

> "We can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. 
This [...] involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired 
knowledge. The prime action of use is **selection**, and here we are halting indeed [...] Our 
ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. 

> "[Instead of alphanumeric indices] the human mind [...] operates by association. With one item 
in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, 
in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain."

Bush introduces the "memex" - a supplement to memory which pulls together microfilm, recording 
technologies, and associative selection. It won't be as fast or flexible as the brain, but it 
could at least improve the clarity and permanence of our recall.

> "This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the 
important thing [...] Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other 
can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space."

Bush is really talking about building "user trails" through these associative indices. In much 
the same way that one book is the associative trail of a mind moving through and selecting 
certain information; Bush has designed a machine to build trails of trails. These trails could 
also be shared: my trail passed into your memex and vice versa - a far more efficient and less 
lossy means of collaboration than simply recommending a book or two.

> "Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails 
running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified [...] There is a 
new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful 
trails through the enormous mass of the common record."

Bush then spends some time speculating on technologies which directly manipulate the human 
nervous system. He ends with this:

> "[Science] may yet allow us truly to encompass the great record and to grow in wisdom. We may 
perish in conflict before we learn to wield that record for our true good. Yet, in the 
application of science to our needs and desires, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate 
stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome."

### The mnemonic medium

Media for thought are all around us: Bush cites the abacus which, through the positional display 
of number relationships it implies, led the Arabs to the concept of 0. Media for thought create 
powerful immersive contexts in which to explore new classes of ideas which were formerly 
impossible. Matuschak and Nielsen take this much, much further.

> 💡 If our media help us remember what matters, we may find our minds are already free.

> "Alan Kay summed up the optimism of this dream when he wrote of the potential of the personal 
computer: 'the very use of it would actually change the thought patterns of an entire 
civilization' [...] for better and worse, computers have affected the thought patterns of our 
civilization over the past 60 years, and those changes seem like just the beginning."

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: Media for thought, like the abacus - or like money and writing - create powerful what?

A: Immersive contexts (which can change the thought patterns of civilizations). 

</Card>

</Flash>

Leveraging the insights of cognitive science, we can create media that make it effortless to 
remember what you've read. The medium builds in the key steps involved in memory. In this 
context, it means adopting highly specialized flash cards in an essay, and spaced repetition 
(SRM) reminders after reading. These may sound trivial, but it takes advantage of a fundamental 
fact about human memory: as we are repeatedly tested on a question, our memory of the answer 
gets stronger, and we are likely to retain it for longer.

Matuschak and Nielsen discuss many preliminary results and argue that though this may seem like 
"just" an essay with fancy flashcards, simple media can still be profound in their unexpected 
implications. Just look at writing. Or money.

Why all this focus on memory, though? Will building mnemonic media really free our thought? 
Remember, Bush showed how new media free our brains from rote tasks: mathematicians are not 
calculators, but people skilled at intuitively grasping higher order logic.

> "Memory systems can be extraordinarily helpful for mastering abstract, conceptual knowledge 
[...] **because of the way the mnemonic medium embeds spaced repetition inside a narrative**. 
That narrative embedding makes it possible for context and understanding to build up."

The key in all this is how you craft the cards: the idea being to make a scalable *memory 
laboratory* which can answer some very deep questions about human memory, how it might be 
improved and practiced, and what impact it can have on our thought and learning.

> "We’ll see that memory systems are a small part of a much bigger picture [...] Seriously 
developing memory systems is likely to lead to one or more transformative tools for thought."

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: What are media with embedded flashcards and spaced repetition trying to make effortless for you?

A: Remembering what you've read.

### Network structures for knowledge

Critically, memory systems need to ensure that people don't just learn surface features; they 
need to help users in innovative ways when they do forget; and they need to encode stories into 
the mnemonic medium. In this sense, you can see the mnemonic media as carrying two texts: the 
actual one and the reflected one, built up by all the knowledge encoded in cards.

However, it is a mistake to think "good memory system == spaced repetition". There is also 
elaborative encoding and the sort of associative trails Bush was talking about; and techniques 
like [the method of loci](https://www.ourmachine.net/writing/memory-i/), though this isn't as 
useful for remembering abstract, conceptual knowledge. Seeing this broader 
perspective allows us to ask much deeper questions, like:

> 💡 What is the ideal network structure of knowledge?

And what does memory have to do with *understanding* and *creativity*?

Conceptual mastery and creativity is actually enabled by a mastery of details. By largely 
automating away the problem of memory, the mnemonic medium makes it easier for people to spend 
more time focusing on other parts of learning, making the awkward early stages easier to get 
through. The link between memory and mastery goes much deeper though, right down to the idea of 
**chunking**, as demonstrated with chess masters in the 1970's.

> "Players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 **patterns of chess pieces**. 
These much more elaborate 'chunks' are combinations of pieces that the players **perceive as a 
unity**, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces 
[...] Memory is, in fact, a central part of cognition."

Of course, we still need to know what to memorize and what the impact of such media will really 
be on people's cognition and behaviour. My sense is that having **transportable user trails**, 
like Bush imagined in '45, would be extremely useful. How to make this wealth of knowledge 
easily shareable? Perhaps encoding them as [12-word mnemonics](/learn/module-2/shelling-out/#mnemonics) inside [a world computer](/learn/module-1/understanding-ethereum/#generalised-compute) might lead us somewhere interesting?

Q: Creativity is largely enabled by what?

A: Mastery of detail.

### Designing insight

Nielsen and Matuschak then discuss what it would have taken to get from Roman numerals to 
Hindu-Arabic numerals from a design perspective.

> "The design and mathematical insights are inextricably entangled: the mathematical insights 
are, in some sense, design insights, and vice versa [... This is] a general truth: *the most 
powerful tools for thought express deep insights into the underlying subject matter* 
[... Mnemonic media] will express deep original insights into memory [...] A truly great 
memory system will be cognitive science of the highest order."

This general truth reveals the deep difference between what Alan Kay called "pop" and "research" 
cultures. Pop culture is great at producing products we consume, but is insufficient for 
creating new tools for thought.

> "The warning is this: conventional tech industry product practice will not produce deep enough 
subject matter insights to create transformative tools for thought [...] The aspiration is [...] 
to create a culture that combines the best parts of modern product practice with the best parts 
of the modern research culture."

<Aligner center>
<Image src="/images/mod3-img/insight-making.png" />
</Aligner>

> "This is not the common argument that making new tools can lead to new subject matter insights 
for the toolmaker, and vice versa. New tools can lead to new subject matter insights for 
*humanity as a whole*, and vice versa, and this would ideally be a rapidly-turning loop to 
develop the most transformative tools."

> "Doing this is a **cultural struggle.** It seems to be extraordinarily rare to find the 
insight-through-making loop working at full throttle [...] You have brilliant researchers who 
think of making as something essentially trivial, 'just a matter of implementation'. And you 
have makers who don’t understand research, who see it as merely a slow and dysfunctional process."

### Extending our mnemonics

The second half of the essay explores tools for thought more generally, starting with two videos 
well worth experiencing yourself.

> "Watching this video is a remarkable **emotional** experience. It’s obvious the person 
narrating the video loves mathematics, and you cannot help but **empathize** [...] It’s tempting 
to overlook or undervalue this kind of emotional connection to a subject. But it’s the 
foundation of all effective learning and of all effective action [...]

> "Is it possible to create a medium which has the emotional range possible in video – a range 
which can be used to convey awe and mystery and surprise and beauty? [...] To create an 
integrated medium, with a unified and carefully crafted emotional and intellectual experience?"

We must take emotion as seriously as movie, music, and video game designers do. All of these 
people have elaborate models for emotional response, which we must also take into account if we 
are to augment our freedom to think with digital tools.

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: The foundation of all effective long-term learning is what?

A: Emotional connection to a subject.

</Card>

</Flash>

> "We need to develop a powerful praxis, a set of core ideas which are explicit and powerful 
enough that new people can rapidly assimilate them, and begin to develop their own practice."

In addition to learning from people already well-versed in crafting experiences, we can also notice that tools for thought are public goods. Thus, they suffer from the same issues around funding as open source software does. Moreover, this funding challenge is not only financial: it speaks to the heart of what we value as a culture, and so building the right kind of practices and processes is primarily a cultural endeavour, rather than one in which we spend endless hours writing grant applications. Why is it worthwhile devoting yourself to an open-ended endeavour like this which isn't as 
well-funded as many other sectors in tech? Well, because:

> "Consider our most fundamental tools for thought – language, writing, music, etc. Those are 
public goods [...] These tools all introduce fundamental new mental representations and 
operations. Those aren’t owned by any company, **they’re patterns owned by humanity**."

> "The creation of language – the ur tool for thought – is perhaps the most important occurrence 
of humanity’s existence [...] Similarly, the invention of other tools for thought – writing, the 
printing press, and so on – are among our greatest ever breakthroughs."

What will new tools for thought *really* look like? Our contention is that protocols for money 
are exactly one such tool and - given that money preceded writing - they are also an ur tool.

> "If we could communicate the experience in an essay, then the tools would be failing at their 
job; they would not be **transforming** a person’s thinking, or even their **consciousness**."

### Executable books

Let's go one step further, by considering an economic argument about what factors *actually* 
affect long-term wealth inequality. It turns out it's **not** the initial distribution of money, but the nature 
of transactions. Because this surprising result is arrived at computationally in 
an <Link to="https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Economics.ipynb">open-source Jupyter notebook</Link>, you can test it yourself, and are invited to find initial distributions which do effect long-term inequalities if you can. The authors call this

> "**Scaffolded exploration**: a way to build up your own understanding, and perhaps even push the 
frontiers of knowledge. It’s tempting to regard [Jupyter notebooks] as merely a mashup of essay 
and code. But really they’re a new media form, with different possibilities from either essays 
or code, and with striking opportunities to go much further.

> "There’s a general principle here: good tools for thought arise mostly as a byproduct of doing 
original work on serious problems [...] Furthermore, the problems themselves are typically of 
intense personal interest to the problem-solvers. They’re not working on the problem for a 
paycheck; they’re working on it because they desperately want to know the answer."

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: Embedding narrative into new tools for thought encourages what process as a way to build up your own understanding?

A: [Scaffolded](/learn/module-3/remember/#how-does-this-fit-into-kernel) exploration.

</Card>

</Flash>

The ultimate aspiration here is to develop canonical media in these new tools, like *2001: A 
Space Odyssey* created for movies. Nielsen and Matuschak suggest that:

> "One fun project would be to develop an executable form of the most recent IPCC climate 
assessment report. Instead of a report full of assertions and references, you’d have a live 
climate model for people to explore. If it was good enough, people would teach classes from it; 
if it was really superb, not only would they teach classes from it, it could perhaps become the 
creative working environment for many climate scientists."

The best example of this currently is *The Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics:*

> "Many theorems aren’t just expressed in static form, on the page, but live, as code which can 
be modified by the user. Theorems become APIs, which can literally be applied to other objects, 
and chained together. It uses a much more powerful underlying model than Jupyter, developing a 
new symbolic language as part of the book."

### Emotional ends

> "It’s striking to contrast conventional technical books with the possibilities enabled by 
executable books. You can imagine starting an executable book with, say, quantum teleportation, 
right on the first page. You’d provide an interface – perhaps a library is imported – that would 
let users teleport quantum systems immediately [...] 

> "You could begin an executable book with material the users already care about, can connect to 
easily, and find motivating [...] but such an opening won’t suffer the drawback of popular 
science, of being vague and imprecise. Rather, the interface would be completely well specified 
and could be scaled out, applied in ever-expanding contexts. The understanding would be 
transferable. Even a user who has understood only a tiny part of the material could begin 
tinkering, building up an understanding based on **play and exploration**."

This is the first part of what it really means to "take back the web". It's about building 
public tools for thought which - like language - are really patterns owned by humanity as a 
whole, in which we can playfully explore with each other the very edges of our shared record of 
knowledge, adding new pieces as scaffolding for those who follow to continue the fun.

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: Stories encoded into new kinds of canonical media which simultaneously allow for greater emotional connection _and_ technical specificity **are public tools for thought** that create understanding based on what two activities?

A: Play and exploration.

</Card>

</Flash>

### References

For truly dramatic unfolding between mind and machine, "the idea that I am me — the person who doesn't know what I haven't learned — has to go away. It is this same idea that often gets in the way of [learning](/learn/module-6/learn) anything new."
