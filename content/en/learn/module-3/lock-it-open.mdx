Weâ€™ve looked in detail at our first two pillars of the week: how we might augment our ability to think for ourselves using transformative tools which are public goods of the sort capable of shifting cultural values; and how we might create more time for ourselves by both being present now and understanding the histories from which we come. Now, we turn to a blog post from Internet Archive librarian Brewster Kahle, which inspired the above presentation by Juan Benet. Both indicate how "Web 3" relates to a larger movement happening across the internet right now, aimed at **re-imagining how we share and relate**. As such, it forms the third pillar of how we "take back the web" - **cooperation baked into the very protocols** we use for collecting, storing, and consulting the shared record which Vannevar Bush spoke of in 1945.

## How does this fit into Kernel?

This week's curated materials have all tried to identify and draw out a particular stream of thought that predates the internet. This is because the internet is just the latest in a long line of attempts to collect and make navigable the sum total of human knowledge. Access to this shared record and the means to move through it meaningfully confer great power. We have a unique opportunity as a generation to ensure both record and means remain open to all.

In particular, both the blog and the video will help you understand more about

The technical history of the web, its different phases, and where it might be headed next.

Why adding **trust** to the read/write web is such an important development.

Verifiability, open services, and market protocols as some examples of the new primitives we can use to build different **incentive** structures into Web 3.

Smart contracts as the basis for permanent and stable digital jurisdictions.

## Brief

> The way we code the web will determine the way we live online. So we need to bake our values into our code. Freedom of expression needs to be baked into our code. Privacy should be baked into our code. Universal access to all knowledge.

### Introduction

Brewster begins his blog by pointing out that the web is fragile and it lacks privacy, though we have at least managed to keep things fun. That means we're currently 1 for 3, and we have a great deal of work to do before we can truly claim the title "web3". He contrasts the world wide web (all the websites you know and love, which are hosted in one place and one place only and which is therefore centralized) with the internet itself: the plumbing system that makes it possible to communicate with light across the globe in the first place and which is very much distributed.

His is an appeal to make the web distributed in the same sense as the internet, an idea which is sometimes grouped with the call for "protocols, not platforms". As we saw all the way back in [Module 0 with Andreas](/learn/module-0/money-language/#open-protocols-and-a-network-of-value), this is beginning to happen and it is happening very fast given that we have now de-platformed money, turned it into a protocol and made it peer-to-peer rather than client-server.

In fact, according to Juan, it is happening at break-neck speed in terms of the evolutionary history of our species, though it simultaneously feels slow to us as individuals now used to communicating at light-speed with anyone, anywhere. He suggests that we should think of it in terms of **periodic waves:** 

- mainframes
- computers 
- GUIs 
- the internet
- the web
- web 2.0
- mobile
- blockchains
- web 3

Why should we care about distributed systems and protocols over platforms? It turns out that there are both good technical and cultural reasons. On the technical front - as Brewster indicates - distrbuted architectures naturally lend themselves to more privacy. Moreover, because they present different challenges in terms of navigability and location-based content, they have necessitated further advancements in content-addressability and peer-to-peer discovery protocols. In turn, these will enable an archival of content to be fully functional, rather than a poor snapshot, enabling rich memory and versioning systems so that the record of human knowledge is not quite so fragile to ongoing decay.

Moreover, distributed systems lend themselves well to [local culture and genuinely civic spaces](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJmqcSlV07SXBLZ2r-nRHFjBRjFy-2-1CT6lVzfv8OA/edit?usp=sharing), both online and off. Brewster often talks about **a globe of villages, not a global village**: we want everyone to be able to connect to whom they please, but we do not want to cultivate monocultures because we recognise that diversity is the natural response to adversity. Fostering plurality is the most lively evolutionary strategy.

As Juan says,

> **"The choices that we make in the technologies we build - the properties we give our products - will have drastic implications not just for ourselves, but for many people in the future."**

In the same spirit of asking [better questions](/learn/module-2/better-questions), Juan then goes on to detail some of the enquiries you can keep in mind as you consider the systems you might build and how they relate to the worlds we all share. These seven questions serve as a generally useful framework when encountering new tools and thinking about their possible effects, both technological and cultural:  

- How do they work?
- How reliable and correct are they?
- How open and accessible are they?
- How safe are they?
- How can they fail?
- Who controls them and how are they governed?
- What rights do they secure/guarantee/grant people?

> "We must be very careful about the things we build. We should care about maximizing human potential; promoting rights; and the long-term flourishing of humanity when thinking about the technologies we create."

### History

There is a difference between "the internet": the wires and networking protocols which evolved mostly from military and academic work from the 1960's and 70's onward; and "the web": hyperlinked documents, static pages, browsers and everything youâ€™re most likely used to.

#### **Web 1 (**1991 to 2000)

Mostly static, read-only content. This also marks the beginning of "online" commercial activity.

#### **Web 2** (the early 2000's)

Its key characteristic is its dynamic, interactive nature as opposed to the largely static content of the 90's. It's often described as "the read-write web" and is more participatory, social, and market-based. This includes not only Facebook and Twitter, but also services like Uber and AirBnB. However, 

> **The advertising model in Web 2.0 is broken.** It optimizes for time spent on pages and tries to keep people and their data locked in. Anger is a great way to generate clicks, so we're increasingly optimizing for negative emotions in order to pay the bills.

#### Web 3 (now)

This next iteration of the web gives us read, write and [trust](/learn/module-0/trust/). 

Web 1.0 was about linking content together. Web 2.0 was about linking programs to that content and building rich, dynamic applications which work across our devices. The decentralized web is about linking content and programs directly to each other, removing intermediaries and gaining public verifiability. It is, as Brewster so often says, "protocols, not platforms".

### The path forward

The aim for us should be to take what Bitcoin did to money and do it to all kinds of services and applications. Bitcoin "thawed the peer-to-peer winter and reminded everyone that we can build these kinds of systems and succeed." Now, it's time to hook into the larger movement happening across the internet to change how the web itself works: how we store, retrieve and consult the shared record of human knowledge. 

The simple property of **verifiability** is the key to all this. The "ability to check" is as powerful as the ability to hyperlink text in your documents was in Web 1.0. It's a new kind of linguistic primitive. Few understand <Link to="https://unifying.thebluebook.co.za/?stackedPages=%2Fstructure">this</Link>, similar to how hyperlinks were misunderstood early in protocol development. 

### Free thought

**It is not just blockchains.** It's "the decentralized web" in general. Blockchains systematize economics and law, and did not actually start on the web - Bitcoin was a protocol built to run separately without needing a browser. So a big part of Web 3 work is to make these things actually talk to each other: **to make blockchains accessible to people**.

Prompt: What simple property of the DWeb is as powerful as the hyperlink?

Verifiability.

</Card>

</Flash>

This goes to the heart of safer, more resilient, and more ethical protocols which can literally encode social contracts in ways which are visible and meaningful to the people using them.

**Open services** and **market protocols** are what we're really able to build with and on the decentralized web. The old economic truths which sank open source peer-to-peer software in the past are no longer true. We can now create commodities out of things that were fixed resources: i.e. storage, computation, and bandwidth. This will allow peer-to-peer to compete with centralized alternatives.

Smart contract systems are the basis of [jurisdictions](/conversation/#roots). They are computable law and it is unlikely that we will tap the full potential of this for many years to come. So, if you want to bake rights into your systems and "lock the web open" as many of us do, then think about what it 
means to encode rules into the jurisdiction of the internet, because that's what is really happening here.  

Many have talked about how this is equivalent to the internet becoming a nation of sorts, perhaps even something like a network state. Beware those who replicate past paradigms obscured by the trappings of new tools. This is one of the reasons we took such time to look at the DWeb Principles in ["Freedom" at the start of this module](/learn/module-3/freedom/#free-software). Encoding rules into the jurisdiction of the internet is about collaboration and agency. It is about [opt-in law](/learn/module-1/dreamers/#learning-the-language). It is about [mutual aid](/learn/module-4/governance), [reciprocity](/conversation/reciprocity), and [care](/learn/module-2/engineering/#further-references). It is about [trust spaces](/learn/module-1/value/#narrative) built upon trustless protocols. It is about [diversity and plurality](https://www.interdependence.online/about).

Prompt: More ethical and resilient products, and new kinds of jurisdiction, both rely on us using the unique features of the dweb to build what?

Open services and market protocols.

### The other web 3

The people who built the linked data, semantic web actually coined the term "Web 3" back in 2004. This idea was started by **Tim Berners-Lee**, and is aimed at making everything interoperable, removing intermediaries and decentralizing the control of information. His approach has been to model ontologies and data so as to connect computers on the machine-readable web.

The most successful Linked Data work ended up powering the Knowledge Graph and the Facebook Open Graph, which is a far cry from the decentralized vision which started it all. Much like the work on transformative tools for thought, this is due to issues around funding public goods which - if nothing else - blockchains can genuinely help solve.

The decentralized web movement, the blockchain movement, and the linked data movement are all part of the decentralized web. **We're in it to build a permanent, ownerless, and borderless foundation for this globe of villages through which we are all related.**
