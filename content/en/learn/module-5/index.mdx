# ðŸ“ˆ Tokens & Mechanism Design

What is a token? Simple questions like this raise all sorts of thorny problems. The dictionary 
informs us that a token is "a thing serving as a visible or tangible representation of a fact." 
Older uses point to badges or favours worn to indicate allegiance, or a _word_ or object 
conferring authority or serving to authenticate.

In computing, the word means either "the smallest meaningful unit of information in a sequence 
of data for a compiler", or "a sequence of bits passed continuously between nodes in a fixed 
order and enabling a node to transmit information." So, a token is some object, word, or 
sequence which - when communicated - authenticates knowledge or possession of some fact which 
grants the holder certain privileges. More succinctly: **tokens transmit information about facts**.

So, what is a fact? [Rich Hickey is the best person to ask about this](https://youtu.be/-6BsiVyC1kM?t=1207) 
from a programmer's perspective. Facts are _values_ which incorporate time because they are 
"an event or thing known to have happened or existed". The word comes from a _past participle_ 
in Latin, **factum**, meaning "something done". This fits in nicely with our work because 
crypto-economic tokens on Ethereum are facts about key value mappings in a shared contract, with a visible trail of the values associated with any one key over the entire existence of the contract.

In fact, the word "token" shares a root with the Germanic and Dutch words for "teach", which 
makes sense given that tokens "teach" factual information. This is the actual use of tokens, 
and mechanisms designed around them, in Web 3: they are tools which can be used to teach by 
creating factual, [verifiable incentives](/learn/module-3/lock-it-open/#the-path-forward) for 
certain behaviours, both individually and collectively.

## Teaching Trust

Now that the definitional challenges are dealt with, we can outline the argument we'll be making this week. We're not interested in the latest DeFi protocol, or specific curves, curation markets, coin offerings and all the other crazes.

We're interested in the [shared dreams](/learn/module-1/dreamers) instantiated by networks of [timestamp servers that challenge regimented political routines](/learn/module-4/the-garden/#shared-realities). In fact, such networks create an entire universe of distributed [trust](/learn/module-0/trust/) in which we can implement [instant settlement and transfer of ownership](/learn/module-0/money-language/#open-protocols-and-a-network-of-value), without requiring intermediaries.

We haven't even scratched the surface of possible mechanisms in such a space. It is that vast. Therefore, we'll take a step back and look at the most successful mechanisms designed at the advent of online commerce; we'll consider the incredible power of narrative and how it is used to both shape and challenge the incentive structures which support power; and then we'll dive into computer game design and the latest research on how to do it in a prosocial manner so as to build better relationships and guard against toxicity and loneliness in our social systems.

As some dear friends point out, "Attracting people around a common goal isnâ€™t new, but coordinating them with a tradable and functional token is very new." Once we have studied how unbounded search through narrative can reveal universes of prosocial value, we can begin to grasp some of the new affordances coordinating people around blockchains provide, an idea [beautifully described here](https://www.daoistry.com/mindsets/blockchain-coordination/).

If you'd like to explore some interesting case studies in order to contextualise some of the theory in this module, we encourage you to:
