# Banking in the Shadows

<Video src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLmtuEaMvhDZbVJfl0Se-1eQncA_2ZB4bs&index=2" />

We have covered the two major stories about the development of money, global trade and finance: 
collectibles and debt. It's now time to look in greater detail at money as it actually works in 
the modern economy. And it's really difficult to do this, because any classical economics 
textbook - even from the 1960's - is already outdated. 

The best resource we know, which is able to take both a long, historical perspective, but then 
ground it in the day-to-day realities of money and banking as they actually work in our era, is 
this course from Perry Mehrling and the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Some videos 
initially included in Kernel are no longer public, but you can find most of the MOOC if 
you look through the new playlists on the INET youtube channel linked above.

## How this fits into Kernel

<Process>

You cannot ask better questions unless you understand something deeply. You cannot understand 
how to disrupt banks and the current financial system unless you know how we got here and what 
it actually is.

This series grounds value, money, speech, and incentives in very real-world, practical terms. 
Literally the entire course is aimed at teaching you how to read the Financial Times and 
translate it into everyday language for your friends.

While not a core learning objective for Kernel, Mehrling approaches money and banking through 
the issue of **liquidity**, rather than solvency, and this is particularly relevant for anyone 
working on DeFi.

</Process>

## Brief

> "**The analytical apparatus of this course is largely balance sheets.**"

> "The two key ideas in this course are thinking of banking as a clearing system - **a payment 
system** - and banking as market making. Additionally, banking as advanced clearing is how we 
bring in finance and forwards and futures and swaps and derivatives etc."

If you watch the whole course, you'll see Mehrling use the classic T account over and over again 
to explain increasingly complex concepts. You'll realise that the T account, or balance 
sheet-style thinking, is just the banker's way of being able to hold in mind complementary 
opposites and demand, very practically, that they balance each other out. It is a powerful, and 
simple, way of understanding the flow of value anywhere in the world.

Q: T-accounts and thinking in terms of balance sheets are just the way bankers navigate the play of what foundational Kernel pattern?

A: Complementary opposites.

### Banks and shadows

Mehrling starts by describing a simple bank: with loans, securities and cash as its assets; and 
deposits, "other borrowing", and a balancing item of "net worth" as its liabilities. If this 
seems familiar and boring, stay with it, because this course is really about that strange term 
"other borrowing", how it relates to the money markets, overnight lending, FedWire and shadow 
banks - all the stuff you were never taught about because they didn't exist in the form they 
now take, especially post-2008.

Moreover, instead of focusing on a positive "Net Worth" - i.e. the solvency of banks - Mehrling 
is going to be looking at that Tamil word for Chinese money: cash and the **liquidity** problem, 
because this is actually the constraint bankers have to face at the end of every day when they 
"clear" their accounts. In many ways Mehrling's course is about **payment systems** and how they 
work in practice, and this is why it's so relevant in the context of peer-to-peer electronic 
payment systems, or open protocols for money.

We have to understand **liquidity** and the **different prices of money** if we are to appreciate 
what it *actually means* to have a payment system which no-one controls, because it is ultimately 
these two constraints which will define what kinds of programmable money are useful, and what 
kinds will fail.

> "We're also going to be talking about **shadow banks**, [by which I mean] an entity that is 
holding Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (loans that have been turned into a kind of bond), 
or Interest Rate Swaps and Credit Default Swaps to mitigate risk so that what is left is a 
short-term, relatively low risk asset that can be used as collateral for borrowing in the 
wholesale money market [...] So, you have money market borrowing as the liability. They're not 
borrowing from you and me, but from money market mutual funds and big corporate investors. The 
instruments they're using are things like Repurchase Agreements, Eurodollars (or <Link to="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-12/global-banks-warn-of-market-chaos-if-court-were-to-abolish-libor">LIBOR</Link>), and 
Asset-Backed Commercial Paper. **The point is: this model is now the dominant one**. The amount 
of credit in the US that runs through this method is much larger than through traditional banks, 
which is what the textbooks are all about."

Shadow banking also faces the issues of solvency and liquidity, but it's more complex than in 
the regular system because the issue of liquidity is really about being able to roll over the 
funding for your RMBS, IRS and CDS. If the money markets freeze up, you can't roll it over and 
you have to liquidate. This is what a lot of the [2008 financial crisis was about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anSPG0TPf84).

Q: What are the two key concepts we must understand to program useful kinds of money and create a functional global system with no owners?

A: Liquidity and the price of money.

The course looks in great detail at the Federal Reserve, which is also a bank. Mehrling begins 
by discussing a 2012 Fed balance sheet and, for instance, the $852 Billion of mortgage backed 
securities it was carrying then. Very pertinently, Mehrling shows how

> "It's just not correct to say that the Fed is 'printing money'. When it is expanding the money 
supply, it is expanding *both sides of the balance sheet*. It is a classic banking operation, 
which happens at all levels of the system."

Whether you agree that it *should* happen is another story, but Mehrling takes great care to 
place himself in an esteemed intellectual tradition which may make you rethink your position. 
In any case:

> "The system has changed dramatically. When people talk about Quantitative Easing 1, QE 2, QE 
3 - they're talking about the transformation of the Fed's balance sheet that I am showing you."

### The 4 prices of money

If we're really going to understand banking as a payment system - as well as the mechanics which 
underpin market making as a valuable activity - we need to understand what the different prices 
of money are and how they come about.

<Process>

**Interest rate (future)** - this is the price of money most economists focus on. It is the 
price of money now in terms of money later. It's how you transform money today into money 
tomorrow. However, there is a more primitive price which gets neglected in most thinking:

**Par (now)** - the price of one money in terms of another money right now. We take it for 
granted that demand deposits and cash reserves in a bank trade at par. In financial crises, 
sometimes par is broken; where private money trades at a different price to central bank money. 
The hybridity of our system is masked by par, but it raises the question of *why does par 
actually work?* Par is critical to the payments system - i.e. par clearing between different 
states (for instance) was created by the Fed. It's not easy to create this, because it is akin 
to a fixed price, which spooks economists. Just ask the people at MakerDAO.

**Exchange rate (foreign)** - the price of domestic money in terms of foreign, or world 
reserve, money. Which leads us to realise that there are, in fact, two dollars. This is well 
highlighted in the <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triffin_dilemma" >Triffin dilemma</Link>. 

**Price level (commodities)** - economists often reference this, imagining that the 
quantity of money moves one-to-one with the price level of commodities. 

</Process>

Mehrling has a unique point of view which will assist you to uncover the actual inner workings of the "tribe of bankers" and how they think about the world so that you can program money both to account for the problems they're actually solving, and go a step further towards a more equitable world in which the bottom line is not the only thing we try to optimize.

> "In this course, we will not be taking sides - pro-banker vs anti-banker - we'll be trying to 
figure out how the system works so that we can approach this as scientists and citizens. The 
world has changed: it's a global financial world. The world of 1950's textbooks is not a world 
with private capital markets, and it's also not global, because the global markets of the 19th 
Century had broken down."

Q: What are the four prices of money?

A: Interest rate, par, exchange rate, and price level.

</Flash>

Mehrling is trying to connect the worlds of finance and banking, so we can move towards a more 
holistic understanding of the overall system. His motto for doing this is simple:

> "**All banking is a swap of IOUs**. By swap, I mean IRS, CDS and the like, but also loans. 
The world of finance thinks they understand everything about *swaps* - derivatives etc. - 
but we're not going to be thinking of swaps in the terms finance people do. We'll be thinking 
of them in the way money people do, in that there is a funding and liquidity piece to swaps and 
that liquidity piece is what drives all the action [...] This is all about the question, 'What 
does financial globalization imply for money and monetary theory'? We're trying to develop 
monetary theory for the real world that is around us now."

### Discipline and elasticity

Thinking in terms of liquidity and payment systems reveals a deep tension between fiscal 
**discipline** and **elasticity**. Mehrling introduces the image of a pyramid, made up of 
different kinds of money - ranging from Federal Reserve notes at the top, to credit instruments 
at the base.

![The modern money pyramid](/images/mod2-img/modern-money-pyramid.png)

The critical point for our present study is that this beating heart, and the tension between 
elasticity and discipline, is currently managed by a group of unelected bureaucrats at the Fed. 
This is - to use Mehrling's phrase - neither a good nor a bad thing; it is a fact thing. They 
attempt to control the inevitable expansions and contractions through interest rates and various 
other, more contentious methods; like expanding the balance sheet and buying Residential 
Mortgage-Backed Securities and similar private instruments. If you're interested in why this is 
potentially not the optimal way to manage a global system, 
please <Link to="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Finance-Bankers-Broke-World/dp/0143116800" >read this book</Link>. 

Most importantly, programmable money means that we can code our financial systems to be 
responsive in ways which the current system simply cannot be. We can program stability in ways 
previously unimaginable. But, we have to understand how hard that really is, why it is so hard, 
and what the trade-offs in achieving it have been throughout history. This is not about 
destroying central banks - Mehrling will convince you of how useful they are (preservation of 
par being but one example).

This is about **changing the kind of money that sits on top of the pyramid** from Federal Reserve 
notes to an ownerless, borderless, global, peer-to-peer ledger which holds us all equally 
accountable. It is about changing the ways in which critical financial organizations can 
respond to the needs of an global and interconnected system, and removing the possibility of 
corruption and manipulation to the greatest extent possible with the technology we have available.

**Stripe's Perspective**

![Stripe](/images/mod2-img/stripe.png)

One of the more interesting institutional perspectives on Bitcoin as the IP layer for payments. ETH - due to its generality - already takes this a step further: you can both browse a .eth site **and** send payments to the _same place_. Though this was written in 2014, we're still fairly early in the face of all the history above.
