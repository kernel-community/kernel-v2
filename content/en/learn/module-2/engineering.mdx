description: Andreas Antonopoulos describes the three features of money - store of value, unit of account, medium of exchange - making the point that we have moved from having to compromise based on what we find in the world around to an ability to engineer the medium itself to meet our preconceived needs, such as a universal ledger of transactions and who can guess what else.

# 💎 Engineering money

<Video src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MxIrc1rxhyI" />

This Andreas Antonopoulos talk goes into more detail about the critical features of money and 
what being able to engineer them really means. We consider it to be one of his more profound presentations.

We've covered the collectible story of money, the links it has to reciprocal altruism and 
the influence this has had on our evolution as a species, and the importance of closed loops of 
circulation and lowered transaction costs. We've looked at the alternative story of debt, the 
deep mythic and religious roots money and morality have in our human story, the link between 
physical currency and violence, and ancient virtual monies and global trade networks. We've looked at modern banking methods, the need for [credibly neutral](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/) currencies which can be programmed to respond in real time to the need for discipline or elasticity, and the importance of liquidity and the different prices of money to a truly global system. Now it's time to get down to engineering truly beneficial protocols for the creation and distribution of value.

## **How does this fit into Kernel?**

This has been chosen for Kernel, in particular, because it speaks directly to:

<Process>

**Value** and how we can use technology to engineer its creation and distribution.

What **money** as a protocol really means for engineers capable of writing economic code.

How we can rethink **incentives** now that we have overhauled the control architecture of money.

</Process>

## Brief

> "**Money is the killer app**. Money is the killer app because it is the foundational technology 
for all commerce and, as such, touches everything. In order to make all the stuff that is beyond 
money - the "blockchain" applications - work as neutral, open, decentralized platforms, we need 
to transact with a neutral, global, decentralized currency. You can't do the commerce, the trade, 
the identity, the land registry, the *everything else* without first having the foundation of a 
fundamentally new way of doing money which is open, borderless, decentralized, censorship-resistant and global."

Remember, what money-as-a-protocol really allows us to do is program incentives at scales never 
before possible. Yes, this means that there are all sorts of interesting high-level use cases 
to go after, but it also implies that the only way genuinely to do so is by thinking about the 
incentives which underpin whatever you want to build. 

> 💡 If you're not altering the incentive structure on which your society runs, you should 
probably just use a database.

One of our biggest problems is understanding the terms we use, and *money* is probably the 
most relevant example of this. In this course, we've described it as an abstraction to communicate value, as a language in its own right, and as a technology older than writing. 'Money' as such is not a definitional term, it's **a general classifier**. We can, at least, talk about its critical features, defined in terms of how we can engineer it: 

<Process>
    
Store of value

Medium of exchange

Unit of account. 

</Process>

"Money" describes things which exhibit some behaviour that allows us to use that thing for one or more of the above purposes. Most importantly, there is always a trade-off between the three. Gold is a great store of value, but a lousy medium of exchange. Visa is a great medium of exchange, but not really a unit of account, or a store of value (as it generally represents a form of debt). When you throw tokens on a blockchain into the mix, things become really confusing, and this is because we're using a descriptive term - "money" - without differentiating between its actual uses.

How do we decide which "things" satisfy the trade-off between these three critical features in 
the most optimal way? We consider: scarcity, portability, durability, fungibility, divisibility, 
acceptability and stability. In this context:

> "Metals aren't very good money, because they have some intrinsic value which is separate from 
the money it represents. Silver and gold can be traded independently for aesthetic reasons or 
other purposes. **This destroys its fundamental function as a medium of exchange.**"

It is a profound point, so pause here for a moment. Most people will tell you that intrinsic value is *required* to make money "money", but the truth is almost the exact opposite. Money is an abstraction which allows us to speak meaningfully about the value of different items otherwise unrelated. If the medium we use to express such transactional relationship has its own intrinsic value, it is not a very functional abstraction.

### Changing the nature of control

> "Metals represented for humanity an era when we used the materials we found around us in the 
world and adapted them to the uses for which they fit [...] Human beings looked around at found 
objects in the world and asked 'How do we take these materials that we have and find suitable 
uses for them?' At this point, we were adapting nature to the uses that we had, but only in a 
peripheral way. Gradually, we became more intrusive in our adaptions and started *molding* 
nature to our needs. We began interacting with nature at a molecular level, turning wood into 
charcoal, or metal into alloys with unique properties better suited to our needs. Then came the 
ability to effect the atomic nature of materials: synthetic fertilizers, fabrics, and plastics 
etc. This is no longer about just finding materials and adapting them to our needs; it's about 
creating materials which fit uses we have *preconceived*. Today, we can effect the subatomic 
structure of things - manipulating nature at the nano scale to create carbon nanotubes etc. 
That is, we are not just manipulating the atomic behaviour of materials; we are giving them new 
physical properties.

> "We just did something similarly amazing to money. Until now, we have taken money as it exists 
in the world, accepted the trade-offs different kinds imply between the three critical features 
and used it as best we can. We accepted the compromise implicit in each type because we could 
not change its fundamental nature. Take paper money: great medium of exchange and unit of 
account; really terrible store of value because of its **control architecture** (don't tell 
your kids what inflation really does!). We adapt our uses to the material, and not the other 
way around. **Until now, because now - for the very first time - we can engineer the fundamental 
properties of money**."

Because the protocols for communicating value are now completely abstracted from the value which 
they communicate, we can create the properties we need, as opposed to adapting the ones implicit 
in any physical media. It's debatable whether this 'engineered money' has served as a good 
medium of exchange and unit of account so far. This is because these two features have as much 
to do with social contracts and the unit in which we choose to measure as they do with technical 
protocols. Andreas' argument is that we can use abstract monetary protocols which we can 
engineer to change gradually higher-order social contracts.

### New conversations

> "Now that we don't have to adapt to compromises, but can engineer trade-offs away, how about 
we invent some characteristics of money that have never existed before? For instance, our money 
is now also a universal ledger of transactions. A trackable, auditable ledger that can tell us 
where money has been and what is has been used for. Or not. Because we can tweak the privacy 
dial and say individuals should have privacy and governments should be accountable. **We can 
reset that societal conversation**."

Again, this final sentence may seem glib, but it's an important point. We can literally reset 
society-level conversations because there has been such a profound innovation in the media 
through which we communicate value. What powerful narrative will your work speak accountable, 
public truth to?

Q: What feature of money which has never existed before does Andreas argue we have already engineered?

A: A universal ledger of transactions.

> "One of the results of compromising with the forms of money we use is that it is very difficult 
to move between the choices you make: if you want to move between dollars and gold, it's not a 
trivial procedure. However, if you want to move from a fully digital, owned asset that is a 
perfect store of value, to a fully digital, owned asset that is a perfect medium of exchange; 
you can now do that. Instead of trade-offs, we can just trade. I can disaggregate the fundamental 
properties of money, on demand: even better, my wallet can do it for me, intelligently."

The technology of money, at base, has always been composed of a system of symbols that allows 
us to communicate value to one another. What is at issue with compromised versions is the 
**control architecture** required to navigate said compromises. Upending control architectures 
might sound like a good thing to do and, in principle, it is, but remember:

> "This morning someone said, 'Disrupt yourself!' Bullshit. Disruption isn't comfortable or 
easy. Disruption means losing your job; it means cannibalizing your profit centre; it means 
destroying your business. You don't do that to yourself! You act like Kodiak - invent digital 
photography in the 80's and then bury it and pretend that no-one knows, only to get upended by 
Nokia who shipped a billion cameras, and they're not even a camera company [...] Engineered 
money, built by a rag-tag crew of anarchists, cypherpunks and misfits who don't care about your 
business plan, or about being legitimized by regulators, is similar. These people have, for 
years now, being laying down on the ground **unassailable facts** faster than anyone can keep up 
with."

What makes one man's fact another's fiction? Arguably; interpretation. However, when you can 
engineer the linguistic protocol which communicates value between people, and create a common 
standard for interpretation - i.e. a language compiler which produces the same output whenever 
you feed it the same code - you get to what Andreas is talking about here: unassailable facts 
that do no rely on any control architecture. They are true by virtue of the language in which 
they are expressed, not because anyone in a position of authority said so.
