# 💸 Money and speech

> 💡 "Put your money where your mouth is!" 

A tamperproof, borderless, ownerless, global record is not *just* money and it's not *just* 
language. It's a new way of simultaneously ordering both which makes possible valuable, 
meaningful communication with anyone, anywhere, in any way we care to program it.

## Magic internet meaning

Although they share a common language arising from the twin practices of [faith and finance](/learn/module-1/playdough-protocols/#faith-and-finance), 
our [narratives](/learn/module-0/conversation) and our [financial records](/learn/module-1/value/#narrative) 
were clearly distinct before 2009. Consequently, there is confusion around the concept of 
"free" speech, because its definition shifts depending on the context: story or money.

Q: Is a tamperproof, borderless, ownerless, global record a new kind of money or a new language?

A: Both!

</Card>

</Flash>

Money as a programmable protocol that relies on a **shared record** no-one owns is a 
development of the *order* of language, which collapses the distinction between narratives 
around which we organize and our record of societal debt. So, what happens to "free" speech?

Meaningful communication is a balance between the fact that your *ability to speak* ought to be 
free, with the fact that you don't get to say whatever you please. Hence we enshrine freedom of 
speech as a constitutional good and implement error-handling for exceptions like hate speech and 
defamation.

Protocols capable of processing valuable narratives, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, render such 
interpretive balancing acts unnecessary. Your ability to [access the network](/learn/module-0/money-language/#open-protocols-and-a-network-of-value) - 
much like TCP/IP - is free in all senses, requiring only a connection that can support you 
speaking in the same language as your peers. Saying anything *meaningful* (i.e. state-changing) 
has a specific, well-defined economic cost, captured in transaction fees which accrue to the 
benefit of those who "listen" to what you have to say.

In some sense, it is the **primary benefit** of this new order of econo-linguistic network we 
now communicate with: everyone is simultaneously free to speak *and* the cost of any kind of 
meaningful speech is well-defined everywhere. We are also provided with a clear definition of 
meaning: any speech act which changes the state of our shared record.

## Regulation vs expense

In blockchains, speech and execution are *one and the same thing* and interpretation is 
deterministic. The protocol has the bare minimum of rules required for consensus, basically: 
you cannot double spend a token. Every peer processes every transaction which passes these 
rules without fear or favour.

The context is determined not by legal interpretation, but by **economics**. Rather than 
enshrining an ideal like "free speech" which we *agree is good*, certain behaviours we *agree 
to be malicious* are made prohibitively expensive. They are not disallowed, just economically 
unsustainable, in much the same way that prevention is better than any cure. Vitalik touches on this in his [Devcon 1 talk](/learn/module-1/understanding-ethereum/) and we'll return to it again and again.

Q: On a blockchain, what you say is deterministically linked to what you pay. We can therefore regulate expression economically by defining meaning as any speech which does what?

A: Changes the state of our (shared) record.

</Card>

</Flash>

You can validate any kind of state transition you like in Eth2, but if it's provably malicious, 
your stake will get slashed. [Programming penalties rather than rewards](/learn/module-6/serenity/#proving-stake) ensures that the only state transitions worth validating are those that maintain a meaningful consensus. It is a profound change in how we regulate expression.

Again, it points at complementary opposites: 

> 💡 The most effective way to free meaning is to price it correctly.

## Math beats bureaucracy

Pricing different kinds of speech appropriately, rather than trying to "protect" a 
culturally-conditioned ideal, has the second-order cybernetic effect of better securing public 
goods. For instance, SSTOREs are a relatively expensive operation/expression because storing 
data on public networks is costly, and it is a cost borne by all of us. Therefore, we agree upon 
a gas price that incentivizes developers to write contracts which store the minimum possible 
information required for state-changing, meaningful transactions.

We could even say that, on freely accessible public blockchains, there is no such thing as free 
speech. There is only increasingly costly expression for increasingly complex kinds of meaning, 
with the incentives programmed such that the costs borne by the speaker are always provably more 
than those imposed on the community of listeners. 

## The expanded view

When we stop "protecting" free speech, but instead price any speech act according to a set of 
explicit consensus rules we all agree to follow, the space of **meaningful communications** is 
greatly expanded.

You may think this unfairly favours the rich, but you'd be wrong. We can **program** our shared 
ledger in any way we care to! If your program favours those already in power, it's because you 
lack creativity, not because of some limitation in the underlying protocol. Look at Gitcoin 
Grants and Quadratic Funding: a speech act which donates $1 to a cause can have nearly as great 
an effect as a donation two orders of magnitude larger, because 
we've [modelled clearly the most optimal way](/learn/module-4/liberal-radical/#optimal-gathering) 
to fund public goods.

> 💡 When there is nothing to protect, we no longer need guards. Without guards, the digital world is not about captive audiences, but creative participation.

Q: Does the convoluted legal concept of free speech even apply to blockchains? 

A: Not really. There is only increasingly costly expression for increasingly complex kinds of meaning.

</Card>

<Card>

Q: Does the lack of free speech limit the ways in which anyone can express themselves?

A: No! The space of possibly meaningful communication is, in fact, expanded greatly.

## Clarifying metaphors

Money-as-a-programmable-protocol is "spoken" as hex-encoded data strings, which are run on and 
interpreted by a monolithic virtual machine which is everywhere and nowhere, so our metaphor can 
only go so far. Despite the descriptive limitations of natural language faced with such a 
construction, we can still be precise about the exceptions to free speech mentioned above and 
how they might be handled in a world which does not "protect" speech, but rather agrees 
communally on its cost. 

<Process>

Hate speech (analogous to malicious behaviour or outright attacks on the network) can be more 
elegantly handled when you are required to have [value-at-a-loss](/learn/module-6/serenity/#a-defenders-game) to speak meaningfully. If you then violate rules which are not just social norms, but executable software, that value is slashed *simultaneously* with your speech and you suffer provably more damage.

<Box>

Defamation comes in two flavours: *per se* (a statement that is obviously defamatory) and *per quod* (the defamatory implication must be proven).
- **Per se** defamation can be more elegantly handled by <Link to="https://our.status.im/discover-a-brave-new-curve/" >mechanisms</Link> like that which runs <Link to="https://dap.ps">dap.ps</Link>. Anyone can vote in a way which "defames" a product or service, but that vote is also an economic signal denoted in tokens, which are sent straight back to the product or service. So, your downvote causes reputational damage while *simultaneously* repaying the people you're damaging (programmed according to a curve which makes votes cheaper the richer/higher the rank of whomever you're voting on is).
- **Per quod** defamation can be more elegantly handled either by some version of <Link to="https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-round-5-funding-our-future/" >negative votes</Link> Gitcoin Grants is currently iterating over, or by reputational systems - hopefully [using profiles and actions](/learn/module-4/self-enquiry/#identity-we-can-live-with) - yet to launch.

</Box>

The (in)famous <Link to="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md">EIP-1559</Link> is a great example of how we price transactional expression at the protocol level, which is where the most contentious <Link to="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2593.md" >debates</Link> occur. Note, however, how such debate centres not on opinion, but engineering <Link to="/learn/module-4/consensus/#1-lack-of-disagreement-is-more-important-than-agreement">trade-offs</Link> and technical proof.

</Process>

More fundamentally, this new order of communication, akin to the appearance of language itself, 
is best demonstrated by the simple fact that you need only memorize 12 magical **words**, 
incant them into an internet-connected machine and you gain immediate access to **monetary value**, 
anywhere in the world. One can even encode a reference to a newspaper headline in the genesis 
block of a network of timestamp servers (Satoshi's wording) which run money-as-a-protocol to 
make a permanent political statement. It is unprecedented.
