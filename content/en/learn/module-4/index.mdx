# ℹ️nternet age institutions

Right, we've taken back the web! Now what? 

It's time for a story. One summer's day in England, a fine young gentleman is out for a stroll, 
or to "take the air" as refined young English gentlemen say. On that fabled island, there is an 
old law called "Free Reign", which specifies that farmers must keep at least one path open to 
the public through their land in order that those so inclined might take the air uninterrupted. 
However, on this fateful day, our fine young English gent happens upon a fence blocking his path. 
He becomes annoyed that some peasant has dared spoil his wonderful stroll and so - with an air 
of legal, nay, _righteous_ justification - he kicks down the fence and proceeds. Of course, he 
is just as quickly trampled by the Brahmin bull in the field, whom the fence was preventing from 
escaping into some unsuspecting and ill-equipped English village.

This story is known as <Link to="https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/" >Chesterton's Fence</Link> 
and has many versions, including a very beautiful one about a lamp, a monk, and the philosophy 
of <Link to="https://ciechanow.ski/lights-and-shadows/" >light</Link>. The moral is: 
don't break down barriers the function of which you do not fully understand. Much like we first 
introduced [the subversive joy of Ethereum](/learn/module-1/) and then returned to a deeper 
understanding of [the current financial system](/learn/module-2/); now that we've looked at what 
it might mean to [reclaim the web](/learn/module-3/) as a creative and collaborative commons, we 
must go back and understand more clearly what kinds of institutions we may need to keep our 
world wide web safe to walk through gaily. 

## This week

That said, institutions need not be things like The Federal Reserve, or a government department, 
or a place you go when you need to spend some time separate from society. We have - for instance - 
the institution of marriage: which is a **practice** or a **custom**. It is in this sense which 
we will be using the word for the rest of Module 4.

This is because the internet routes information around slow-moving bureaucracies and so requires 
that we update the practices and customs we use to relate to one another and **organize ourselves**. 
In particular, it has caused - and will continue to cause - critical shifts in three spheres of 
human life: how we identify ourselves, how we reach consensus, and how we experience time. Cast 
in the language of anarchy - which really means no rulers, not no rules - these views of 
institution-as-practice or custom can be collected under the 
term <Link to="https://abahlali.org/files/Graeber.pdf">"counterpower"</Link>:

> Institutionally, counterpower takes the form of what we would call institutions of direct 
democracy, consensus and mediation; that is, ways of publicly negotiating and controlling that 
inevitable internal tumult and transforming it into social states (or if you like, forms of 
value) that society sees as the most desirable: conviviality, unanimity, fertility, prosperity, 
beauty, however it may be framed.
