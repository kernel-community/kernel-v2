# Kernel

### A custom web3 educational community

We are building an open, peer-to-peer, lifelong network of awesome humans, one block at a time. Each block accommodates 250 individuals and runs for 8 weeks. It is a unique experience.

Together, we are joyfully subverting the status quo.

# Learn

Whether you have no idea what a blockchain is, or have been building all the decentralized things since 2009, our community will help you learn what you need to know to participate in building a better web, together.

# Question

While we provide 8 weeks of structured learning and building, our course material is entirely free for anyone to read at any time and is intended to help you ask better questions, rather than to provide ready-made answers.

# Play

Conversation forms the heart of how we learn here, but sometimes we need to explore different, more skills-oriented contexts with less words and more games, project building, mindful movement, or quiet sitting. Guilds are where all this and more happens.

# Discover

Our community of learners has helped create one of the most wide-ranging and up-to-date curated collections of resources for people building new tools and products on web3. From designs, to specification, smart contracts, security, and even zero-knowledge tools, it's all here in one easy place.
