# Kernel

### A curated community of brilliance in web3

We are building an open, peer-to-peer, lifelong network of the most talented individuals in the blockchain space, one block at a time. Each block accommodates 250 individuals and runs for 8 weeks. It is a unique experience.

Together, we are joyfully subverting the status quo.

# Question

While we provide 8 weeks of structured learning and building, our course material is entirely free for anyone to read at any time and is intended to help you ask better questions, rather than to provide ready-made answers.
