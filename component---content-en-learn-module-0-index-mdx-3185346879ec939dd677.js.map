This means you'll need to return to do future reviews. In a conventional course, you‚Äôd forget most of what you learned over time, perhaps retaining a handful of ideas. However, with spaced repetition built into the medium, a small additional commitment of time means you will remember significantly more. Doing this won‚Äôt be difficult, it will be easier than the initial read. Furthermore, you‚Äôll be able to read other material which builds on these ideas. It will open up an entire world.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Please indulge us by playing with the prompts you find in the text.

If not, that‚Äôs also fine, just note the reminder and continue.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This spaced-repetition approach is why the prompts only require a few seconds to read and answer.
