The concept of ‚Äúopponent processing‚Äù is not only applicable to individual cognition: but the distributed cognition we call ‚Äúgovernance‚Äù and ‚Äúculture‚Äù. John points out that democracy is based on this idea, opponents debating perspectives based on preferences which are representative of groups of people. However, modern politics interprets these debates as adversarial‚Äìsomeone has to win and winning means convincing the other of the rightness of my view‚Äìwhereas opponent processing is not really meant to be such a finite game. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Opponent processing does not end in win or loss conclusions: the idea is that meeting opponents honestly, listening openly, and engaging truly is an infinite game the ongoing outcome of which is ‚Äútransframing‚Äù: transformation, transcendence, and reframing. Dialogue with those who differ from us has the potential to fundamentally change our perception of our self and the world.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If we are not allowed to engage honestly with one another, in immediate and direct contact, then we cannot find our way to the collective wisdom which is the necessary result of transframing when it occurs between large groups of people. `}</p>\n    <p>{`What is fascinating here is that `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-2/money-speech/\"\n      }}>{`blockchains fuse money and speech`}</a>{`, meaning that `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-4/self-enquiry/#further-references\"\n      }}>{`expression and (economic) action`}</a>{` occur simultaneously. This opens up the field for transframing further. The speech act is one of the most potent ways we have to transfer meaning.
