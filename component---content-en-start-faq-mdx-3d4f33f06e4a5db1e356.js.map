This is the only requirement for participation. Each Thursday, we host a Fireside talk with an industry expert, which generally takes another 1h30 of your time and each track has a weekly call with their own focus, which is also around 1hr or 1h30 long. In total, this comes to around 3h30 per week.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Then, there are three or four `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Curated Materials`}</strong>{`, which are summaries of talks, podcasts, or longer essays from various parts of the interwebz. Reading these briefs should take around an hour in total (could be more or less depending on how you read and whether English is your first language). This is the next level of possible engagement, which will lead you to ask better questions in Slack and on the weekly track-specific and Fireside calls.`}</p>\n      <p>{`If you watch the embedded videos, listen to the podcasts, and read the full essays, this can take up to 3-6 hours, depending on the module.
