That means we're currently 1 for 3, and we have a great deal of work to do before we can truly claim the title \"web3\". He contrasts the world wide web (all the websites you know and love, each of which are hosted in one place and one place only and which is therefore centralized) with the underlying internet itself: the plumbing system that makes it possible to communicate with light across the globe. THe internet is very much distributed.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Brewster‚Äôs blog post is an appeal to make the web distributed in the same sense as the internet, an idea which is sometimes grouped with the call for \"protocols, not platforms\". As we saw all the way back in Module 0 with `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-0/money-language/#open-protocols-and-a-network-of-value\"\n      }}>{`Module 0 with Andreas Antonopoulos`}</a>{`, this transformation is beginning to happen and it is happening very fast now that we have already de-platformed money, turned it into a protocol and made it peer-to-peer rather than client-server.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In fact, according to Juan Benet, this is happening at break-neck speed in terms of the evolutionary history of our species, though it feels slow to us as individuals used to communicating at light-speed with anyone, anywhere. `}</p>\n    <p>{`You can think of the development in terms of `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`periodic waves`}</strong>{`:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`mainframes`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`personal computers `}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`GUIs `}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`the internet`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`the web`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`web 2.0`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`mobile`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`blockchains`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`web 3  `}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <Flash mdxType=\"Flash\">\n      <Card mdxType=\"Card\">\n        <p>{`Prompt: The internet is the latest wave in a periodic series, all created by our attempts to collect and make navigable the sum total of what?`}</p>\n        <p>{`human knowledge.`}</p>\n      </Card>\n    </Flash>\n    <p>{`Why should we prefer distributed systems and protocols over platforms? It turns out that there are both good technical and cultural reasons. `}</p>\n    <p>{`On the technical front, Brewster shows how distributed architectures naturally lend themselves to more privacy. Moreover, because they present different challenges in terms of navigability and location-based content, they have necessitated further advancements in content-addressability and peer-to-peer discovery protocols. These make possible a fully functional archival of content, rather than static snapshots. Such techniques also enable rich memory and versioning systems so the record of human knowledge will be less fragile to ongoing decay.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Furthermore, distributed systems lend themselves well to `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJmqcSlV07SXBLZ2r-nRHFjBRjFy-2-1CT6lVzfv8OA/edit?usp=sharing\"\n      }}>{`local culture and genuinely civic spaces`}</a>{`, both online and offline. Brewster often speaks of `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`a globe of villages, not a global village`}</strong>{`: we want everyone to be able to connect to whom they please; we do not want to cultivate monocultures because we recognise that diversity is the natural response to adversity. Fostering plurality is the most viable evolutionary strategy.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As Juan says,`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\"><strong parentName=\"p\">{`\"The choices that we make in the technologies we build - the properties we give our products - will have drastic implications not just for ourselves, but for many people in the future.\"`}</strong></p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`In the spirit of asking `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-2/better-questions\"\n      }}>{`better questions`}</a>{`, Juan goes on to detail some of the enquiries you can keep in mind as you consider the systems you might build and how they will relate to the worlds we all share.
