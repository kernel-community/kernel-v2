There is a sequence at work here - first trustless protocol, then new kinds of trust spaces; first hard diegetic boundary and autonomous world, then new possibilities for meaningful (therefore subjective) games - but it is critical to note that creating clear boundaries is not an end in itself: it is actually the very thing which enables more information to pass between more regularly.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Of course, the declaration and the pluriverse don't look much like traditional games, though many which do - like `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://zkga.me/\"\n      }}>{`Dark Forest`}</a>{` - exhibit similarly bounded permeability.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The core point about the freedom to play with boundaries is that truly skillful players - those magisters of the infinite arts - know that the core skill is humility.
