He describes:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`\"how collectibles lowered transaction costs in each kind of wealth transfer – in the voluntary\nfree gift of inheritance, in voluntary mutual trade or marriage, and in the involuntary\ntransfers of legal judgments and tribute `}{`[...]`}{` Durable collectibles, what today we would call\nheirlooms, could persist for many generations and added substantial value at each transfer –\noften making the transfer even possible at all.\"`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`We'll be exploring this idea later in the course through the context of gifts, which we feel\nprovide another, perhaps more profound, level of understanding to these types of transactions,\nbut Szabo's argument about lowered transaction costs is nevertheless well worth reflecting on.\nHe goes on to provide a most fascinating example: the Kula trading network of pre-colonial\nMelanesia.

For example, food is\nworth much more to starving people than to well-fed ones. However, the trust required to make\nthe requisite trades was often lacking between tribes, and so collectibles substituted for\notherwise necessary but non-existent long-term trust relationships. In tandem with this kind of\n\"starvation insurance\", Szabo advances a theory of trade-based predation - pointing out that\nmany palaeolithic tribes specialized in hunting only one kind of species, which often migrated\nseasonally, i.e. reindeer or bison. Importantly:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`\"It is not enough, for the theory of collectibles put forth in this paper to be correct, that\nsingle beneficial trades were possible.

These institutions, more than trade, served as the motivator and\nincubator of the earliest primitive money.\"`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`This is a contentious argument, but the point remains that collectibles act as a container for\nmemory across generations, and our memories of who we are and what we owe extend far beyond\nmere trade relationships.`}</p>\n    <Flash mdxType=\"Flash\">\n      <Card mdxType=\"Card\">\n        <p>{`Prompt: In order to achieve the lower transaction costs Szabo claims are a feature of money-as-collectibles, the collectibles must move in what kind of loops of mutually beneficial trade?`}</p>\n        <p>{`Closed.`}</p>\n      </Card>\n    </Flash>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"mnemonics\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}>{`Mnemonics`}<a parentName=\"h3\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#mnemonics\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"mnemonics permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor-link after\"\n      }}><span parentName=\"a\">{`¶`}</span></a></h3>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`\"Often collectibles not only embodied wealth, but also served as a mnemonic, representing the\ntitle to a clan position of responsibility and privilege.\"`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`This has always been true, and in an even deeper sense that Szabo is getting at here.
