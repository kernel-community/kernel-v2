We have had 800+ Fellows go through the course, testing it, improving it, and building their own projects based on what they learned over the 8 weeks in which each course runs. This has resulted in 100+ new projects and companies formed to work on various aspects of “web 3”, and over $40M raised. While there are many great blockchain courses, we are comfortable that Kernel offers the broadest content and does so in a unique way: all of it is `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/kernel-community/kernel-v2\"\n      }}>{`open source`}</a>{` and freely available to anyone, anywhere.

In the first piece, Nick Szabo quotes Richard Dawkins who wrote, “money is a formal token of delayed reciprocal altruism”. Szabo uses this idea to develop a theory of collectibles built around closed loops of mutually beneficial trades. Critically, these collectibles act as intergenerational containers not just for wealth, but for `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`memory`}</strong>{`: wampum shells are valuable in and of themselves, but the way they are arranged on a belt or necklace encodes narrative information about a treaty or event or previous owner which moves along with it, increasing its value over time and amortizing the cost of transport and trade. The mnemonic medium is not just about better memory, cognition, and creativity: it must `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`also`}</em>{` be about delayed reciprocal altruism and the wealth of intergenerational knowledge and value which we all stand to inherit if we can build tools to more fully and carefully consult the human record.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Matuschak and Nielsen understand this, but lack a viable economic solution. The dream is the same as it was with Vannevar Bush and Doug Engelbart and Alan Kay: build transformative tools for thought, “'the very use of which would actually change the thought patterns of our civilization”. Using the latest insights from cognitive science, Matuschak and Nielsen claim that the mnemonic medium can approach this lofty goal by embedding spaced repetition inside a narrative.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It’s a fascinating claim, but they themselves identify the same old issue with such work: funding. Their struggle is primarily cultural, because what the development of transformative tools for thought requires is a combination of the best parts of modern product practice with the best parts of modern research culture. However, a tool which will transform the thinking of a civilization cannot be owned: it must be a `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`pattern used by humanity`}</strong>{`, in the same sense as language is. It has to be a public good, but where can we find the money to fund the development of a public praxis and core set of ideas powerful enough to shift the thinking patterns of civilization?

However, in order to sign up for the spaced repetitive prompts, you need to connect an Ethereum wallet and pay a fee.

This is a `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`general economic design`}</em>{` for continuous online learning environments.

DeSchool is used to create any new course. These courses need not be based on spaced repetitive prompts. All that is required to launch a new course is a “fee”, a \"duration\" in blocks for the course to run, a \"url\" where the course lives and an address for its creator where yield earned on staked fees can be sent.`}</p>\n    <p>{`DeSchool accepts the fee when any learner registers and locks it in a low-risk yield-bearing protocol. It then returns the fee to the learner if they choose to claim it back after the duration of the course. Alternatively, it sends the fee to the Learning Curve, which mints LEARN (an ERC20 token) and returns that to the learner. Once the duration of the course is passed, without any assessment, learners may claim their fee back, while DeSchool ensures the yield is always returned to the creator. `}</p>\n    <p>{`In fact, DeSchool has no other notion of a \"completed\" course, because we believe education is moving away from assessment and examination and `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/module-metta/school-sucks/#certified-confusion\"\n      }}>{`toward participation`}</a>{` and open source attribution.

Anyone can send LEARN to the contract, which it “burns” as it returns the underlying collateral.
