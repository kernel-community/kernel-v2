I'm wary of what the mere abstract wish for everyone to agree does to both a person who has the wish, and to the world. As is mentioned later in Kernel, diversity is nature's response to adversity. If that is so, then we should never aim for complete agreement, but rather trust the process of disagreement to enable something truly useful to emerge over time, some kind of rough consensus which will be (for the moment) both robust and reasonably fair. Knowing that not all will agree that it is fair, we may decide to take steps to protect the rights and maybe even the feelings of those who do not agree, even while going forward with the motion in question and defending ourselves against those who might mean us harm.
